.SH NAME
leafnode \- NNTP server for small (dialup) sites

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B leafnode -V
.br
.B leafnode [-D debugmode] [-F configfile]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
The design of
.B leafnode
is intended to self-repair after problems, and to require no
manual maintenance.
.PP
The
.B leafnode
program itself is the NNTP server.  It is run from
.I /etc/inetd.conf
when someone wants to read news.  The other parts of the package, 
.B fetchnews
and
.B texpire,
are responsible for fetching new news from another server, and for
deleting old news.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.I -D debugmode
Switch on debug mode. This will log a lot of information via syslog to
the facility "news" with the priority "debug". Useful for tracking down
problems with your upstream server(s). If debug mode has already been
set in the config file, increase verbosity. See
.I @sysconfdir@/config.example
for a description of this parameter.
.TP
.I -F configfile
Read configuration from an alternative file instead of @sysconfdir@/config.
.TP
.I -V
Report leafnode version and exit.

.SH "ACCESS CONTROL"
No network-level access control is supported.  This is a deliberate
omission: Implementing this is a job which should not be redone for each
and every service.
.PP
I recommend that either firewalling or tcpd be used for access control.

.SH FILES
All the files in
.I @sysconfdir@
.B must
be readable, but not writable, by user "news".
.PP
.I @sysconfdir@/config
contains the configuration parameters for
.B leafnode.
See
.B CONFIGURATION
below.
.PP
.I @sysconfdir@/users
contains the passwords if authenticate = internal is set. See
.B GENERAL OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
below.
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@
contains the news articles; e.g.
.I @SPOOLDIR@/alt/fan/agulbra
contains the articles in the
.I alt.fan.agulbra
group.  Each directory contains articles in numbered files (decimal
numbers, monotonically increasing), and a special file called
.I .overview
which contains the "Subject", "From", "Date", "Message-ID",
"References", "Bytes" and "Lines" headers for each article in the
group.
.PP
Several subdirectories are special:
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@/leaf.node
contains the files that leafnode creates during operation, for example the
.BR groupinfo
file which contains information about each USENET newsgroup. This file
is built by
.BR fetchnews (8).
You can force a complete rebuild of the groupinfo file by calling
.BR fetchnews
with the parameter -f (see
.BR fetchnews (8)).
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@/out.going
contains local postings that
.BR fetchnews (8)
is to pass to the upstream NNTP server.
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@/failed.postings
contains local postings that the upstream server rejected.
.BR fetchnews (8)
will create files in this directory, but none of the
.B leafnode
programs will delete anything in it.
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@/message.id
contains hard links to each message; this is used in place of the
.B dbz
database typically used by bigger servers.  (A directory such as this
is probably more efficient for the small servers
.B leafnode
is designed for but scales very badly.)
.PP
.I @SPOOLDIR@/interesting.groups
contains one file for each group an NNTP client has asked to read.
.B leafnode
will touch the the relevant file when a LISTGROUP, XOVER, XHDR, STAT,
HEAD, BODY or ARTICLE command is issued immediately after a GROUP
command is issued, and
.BR fetchnews (8)
will retrieve all new articles in all groups whose files have been
either
.IP
- touched during the past two days, or
.IP
- touched more than once, and at least once within the past week.
.PP
.I /etc/inetd.conf
contains the line which starts
.B leafnode.
It is strongly recommended to start
.B leafnode
as user news.

.SH CONFIGURATION
All configuration is done using the file
.I @sysconfdir@/config.
.B All global parameters must be mentioned before server and
server-specific parameters.
.PP
The file has a rather standard Unix format: one line per argument, comments
are introduced by a hash mark (#) and last until the end of the line. Below
are examples on how the various parameters are specified.
.PP
.B MANDATORY PARAMETERS
.TP
server = news02.bigprovider.com
"server" is used by
.BR fetchnews (8)
to select what NNTP server(s) to retrieve news from and to post your
articles to. You can specify more than one news server; in that case,
the servers will be queried from the top down. If you want to post
articles, at least one of your servers should allow you to post.
In the example above, news02.bigprovider.com is the news server.
.TP
expire = 5
"expire" is the number of days a thread should be kept around. In the
example, five days after the thread has last been read, it is deleted by
.BR texpire (8).
.PP
.B SERVER-SPECIFIC OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.TP
username = myname
If any of your news servers requires authentification, you can enter
your username on that server here. This field may occur multiple times,
once after each server definition.
.TP
password = mypassword
If any of your news servers requires authentification, you can enter
your password on that server here. This field may occur multiple times,
once after each server definition.  Since the password is available in clear
text, it is recommended that you set the rights on the config file as
restrictive as possible, otherwise other users of your computer will be able
to get your password(s) from that file.
.TP
timeout = 30
By default, leafnode tries to connect for 10 seconds to a server and then
gives up. If you have a slow server, you can try for a longer time by
setting the timeout higher (in this example, 30 seconds). The timeout
can be tuned individually for each server.
.TP
nodesc = 1
Some servers do not deliver news groups descriptions correctly because
they cannot parse the LIST NEWSGROUPS command. In that case, put this line
after the "server" line.
.TP
port = 8000
By default, leafnode tries to connect to its upstream news servers on the
NNTP port (119). If your servers run on a different port, you can specify
those here. This field may occur multiple times, once after each server
definition.
.TP
usexhdr = 1
fetchnews will usually use XOVER to retrieve header information from the
remote server. Under special circumstances, it may be faster to have it
use XHDR instead. This line will try to enforce XHDR, but fetchnews will
still fall back to XOVER if you also want to use filters in a group or
if you work with "delaybody" set (because in these cases it will always
be faster to use XOVER).
.TP
dontpost = 1
Set this if you do not want postings to be sent to this server.

.PP
.B GENERAL OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.TP
authenticate = internal
Require that NNTP clients authenticate themselves. If set, leafnode
expects a file @sysconfdir@/users which lists users and their
passwords. The file has one line per user, with the user name (which
cannot contain spaces), then a colon (:), then the crypt(3) encrypted
password.

To generate these lines, you can use the Perl program
.IR tools/make_pass.pl ,
for example, if you want to add a user
.I enigma
with  a password of
.IR break!me ,
type:

perl -wT tools/make_pass.pl 'enigma' 'break!me'

and copy the resulting line to the
.I @sysconfdir@/users
file.
.TP
hostname = host.domain.country
If your messages do not already have message IDs (generated by the
newsreader), Leafnode will generate a message ID for them. However,
it will never ever overwrite an existing message ID. By default,
it tries to do this from the name of your computer. However, some
upstream servers demand message IDs of a certain type. In this case,
you can override the name of your computer by setting "hostname" to
a sensible value. The use of "hostname" to create fancy message IDs
is possible, but strongly discouraged.
.TP
create_all_links = 1
Normally, fetchnews will store articles only in the newsgroups which you
consider interesting. If you set "create_all_links", fetchnews will create
hardlinks for all newsgroups which it can find in the Newsgroups: header.
This may be of interest if you want to apply a score- or killfile to the
Xref: line.
.TP
maxfetch = 1000
"maxfetch" specifies the maximum number of articles
.BR fetchnews (8)
should fetch from the upstream server in each group. Its use is not
advised, because if you use it you will not see all the traffic in a
group. By default there is no limit.
.TP
initialfetch = 1
"initialfetch" defines how many articles from a newly subscribed group
should be fetched. The default is to fetch all old articles, which can
get quite time-consuming when subscribing to a very busy group. This
is equivalent to setting initialfetch to zero. If you want to get no
old articles when subscribing to a new group, you should set initialfetch
to one, as in the example above.
.TP
groupexpire = very.crowded.group 1
.TP
groupexpire = very.crowded.hierarchy.* 1
"groupexpire" makes it possible to adjust expiry times for individual
groups. Expiry times are given in days. This value is used by
.BR texpire (8).
You can specify as many groupexpire lines as you like. It is
possible to specify
.BR glob (7)-like
wildcard expressions.
.TP
filterfile = @sysconfdir@/filters
Leafnode can filter the input headers for arbitrary regular expressions.
These are stored in a file designated "filterfile". The format of "filterfile"
is described in
.BR fetchnews (5).
.TP
timeout_short = 2
By default, a group that has been accidentally touched is being fetched
for two days. You can change this time by changing timeout_short.
.TP
timeout_long = 7
By default, a group that has not been read at all is being fetched for
seven days before being unsubscribed. This interval can be changed by
setting timeout_long to a different value.
.TP
timeout_active = 90
By default, active files from the upstream servers are re-read every
90 days. This interval can be changed by setting timeout_active to
a different value. Be aware that reading an active file transfers
about one MB of information if the server that you are using carries
a reasonable number of groups (i.e. around 20,000).
.TP
delaybody = 1
With this option set,
.BR fetchnews (8)
fetches only the headers of an article for visual inspection. Only
when the headers have been read, the bodies of the articles will
be retrieved the next time
.BR fetchnews (8)
is called. This can save a huge amount of download time and disk space.
.TP
groupdelaybody = some.news.groups.*
If you want delaybody mode only for selected groups, you can enable
this download mode for one specific group.  The global delaybody
switch above causes all groups to be treated that way, groupdelaybody
enables delaybody for all groups matching the pattern.
.TP
debugmode = 260
With this option set,
.BR fetchnews (8), texpire (8)
and
.BR leafnode (8)
will start to log lots of debugging output via
.B syslog (8)
to news.debug. Use it for tracking down problems with your feed. See
config.example for details.

.TP
.B XPAT

.PP
The rest of the commands given in the NNTP RFC or added in other
servers are left out in order to keep the server simple and bug-free.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
.I NOPOSTING
When this environment variable exists, the client cannot post. The
server will send a 201 no posting banner. Additionally, if this variable
is non-empty, its contents are appended to the initial banner.

This is useful in context with hosts.allow when your leafnode runs under
tcp_wrappers access control, for example (this assumes your libwrap is
compiled with -DHOSTS_OPTIONS):

leafnode: 192.168.1.4: allow
.BR

leafnode: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0:allow:setenv NOPOSTING -
.BR

leafnode: ALL: deny

Would allow full access to 192.168.1.4, read-only access to the other
IPs in 192.168.1.* an deny access from all other clients.
