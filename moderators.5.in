.SH NAME
moderators \- moderator configuration file for fetchnews(8)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.P
The moderators file defines which groups are handled by which moderator
(by mail address).
.SH SYNTAX
Leafnode's \fImoderators\fR file format is supposed to be compatible with INN's
\fBmoderators\fR(5) file format. A \fImoderators\fR file consists of lines, each of
which can have either of these three formats:
.IP "Empty lines"
are ignored. They are useful to structure the file.
.IP "Comment lines"
are lines that start with a hash character (#) in the leftmost column.
These are also ignored and useful to structure and document the file.
.IP "Moderator lines"
are of the form
.nf
.sp
pattern:moderator
.sp
.fi
where \fIpattern\fR is a \fBwildmat\fR(5) pattern to match the newsgroup's
name and \fImoderator\fR the moderator's mail address. The latter can be
empty, which means that there is no moderator for the group or pattern
(and fetchnews should post into the group rather than detour the message
to the moderator). The \fImoderator\fR may contain one %s pattern, which
will be replaced by the group name with dots (.) converted to dashes
(-). %% in the \fImoderator\fR will be replaced by %. The behavior for
other sequences starting with % is undefined.
.SS Matching
Patterns will be tried in the order listed in the file, until the first
match which terminates the search.
.SH EXAMPLE
An example says more than thousand words, so here goes a commented one:
.P
.nf
\f[CR]# special moderator, all articles posted for local.special
# will be mailed to hans@example.com
local.special:hans@example.com

# egon is moderator for all other local groups:
local.*:egon+%s@example.net
# that line means:
# mail postings for local.test to egon+local-test@example.net
# mail postings for local.video to egon+local-video@example.net
#
# Note: if you put local.special below local.*,
# local.special would be ignored.

# Post gmane.* articles rather than mailing them,
# overriding the catchall pattern for isc.org below:
gmane.*:

## Direct all other public hierarchies to the
## master moderator database.
*:%s@moderators.isc.org
