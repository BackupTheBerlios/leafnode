newsgroup specific filters and filtering per size

* READING

[Incompat] leafnode-2 does not offer direct access to the spool
directory any more.  Use NNTP instead.

* POSTING

leafnode-2 doesn't care for out.going file permissions when posting, it
receives postings in temp.files and will link them to out.going or
in.coming only after they've been completely received. Do not modify the
permissions in out.going.
