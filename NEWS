2.0b-snapshot:
incompatible changes:
- Fix: timeout_active is back!
  This can cause "cannot stat /var/spool/news/leaf.node/:active.read: No
  such file or directory" to be logged until leafnode has succeeded to
  issue "LIST" on all its upstream servers. This message is harmless.
- IMPORTANT: leafnode now automatically appends "leafnode" to your
  sysconfdir. For backwards compatibility, ./configure will strip a
  trailing "/leafnode" or "/leafnode/" so you don't end up with your
  configuration in /etc/leafnode/leafnode/config.
- The "dontpost" configuration option is replaced by "feedtype=none".
- Debug logging to syslog and console is now only enabled if the
  debugmode figure is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), to cut down the size of
  logging in verbose mode somewhat.

other changes:
- no longer installs the "lsort" program. You can remove it from
  /usr/local/sbin/lsort
- fetchnews now logs how many articles could be filtered from pseudo
  headers generated from XOVER data already. Look for "group.name: XOVER
  N to get, M filtered" lines.
- the filterfile and applyfilter manual pages have been updated
- Add: Rnews is back!
- There is a new "only_fetch_once" option, that reads a group only from
  the first server queried that carries this group. Suggested by Jörg
  Mensmann.
- Only change permissions/owner of leafnode directories when creating
  them. Requested by Kevin Bulgrien.
- delaybody is back!  (Ralf Wildenhues)
  delaybody mode can now be enabled for all or selected groups only,
  specified by wildcard patterns with the "groupdelaybody" option.
- fetchnews revamped (Ralf Wildenhues)
  It is now possible to query all or some newsgroups only, fetch several
  articles by Message-ID and fine-tune fetching of headers and bodies
  of delaybody groups as well as articles in regular groups.
- fetchnews and rnews no longer use a two-stage approach -- the
  .overview files are updated as articles are stored, this should profit
  from caches.
