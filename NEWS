2.0b8_ma10pre4:
- IMPORTANT: leafnode now automatically appends "leafnode" to your
  sysconfdir. For backwards compatibility, ./configure will strip a
  trailing "/leafnode" or "/leafnode/" so you don't end up with your
  configuration in /etc/leafnode/leafnode/config.
- Rnews is back!
- The "dontpost" configuration option is replaced by "feedtype=none".
- There is a new "only_fetch_once" option, that reads a group only from
  the first server queried that carries this group. Suggested by Jörg
  Mensmann.
- Only change permissions/owner of leafnode directories when creating
  them. Requested by Kevin Bulgrien.
