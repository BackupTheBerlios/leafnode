20031122a: Changes since 20031028a:
- Feature: applyfilter -c checks in -n mode if filters would match the
  files (rather than newsgroups) given on the command line.
  Suggested by Reiner Steib.
- Feature: applyfilter can now handle more than one newsgroup argument.
- Bugfix: Do not post unless we have an active file. Avoids a crash
  reported by Robert Marshall.
- Cleanup: Fetch active file before trying to post.

20031028a: Changes since 20031026a:
- Bugfix: Change "ulong" to "unsigned long" to make the package compile
  on FreeBSD. Reported against 20031019a by Jack Raats.
- Cleanup: Use rbtrees rather than custom unbalanced binary tree for
  reading the local groups.  -45 lines of code.
- Update: libredblack now at 1.3.

20031026a: Changes since 20031019a:
- Change: log all warnings when verbosity is > 0
- Bugfix: do not interpret group name that starts with a dot as the end
  of server output (fetchnews).
- Bugfix: refuse to add newsgroups with NULL components (leading or
  trailing dot or two adjacent dots).
- Change: Improve error reporting when a server disconnects.

20031019a: Changes since 20031009a:
- Revamp applyfilter, now more robust.
- Reply 440 rather than 500 if user tries to POST in NOPOSTING mode.
- GROUP article number fixes, to avoid bogus new article "offering" in
  newsreader, reported by Reiner Steib.

20031009a: Changes since 20031001a:
- Bugfix: applyfilter no longer chokes on 0-sized articles and will
  unconditionally deleted them. Reported by Reiner Steib.
- Bugfix: leafnode was unable to retrieve pseudo articles with XOVER n
  or XOVER n- forms (XOVER n-m was fine).
- Bugfix: does not crash on a fresh install. Reported by Jürgen Salk.
- Documentation: fix typo (syslogd.pid) in README.html. Reported by
  Jürgen Salk.

20031001a: Changes since 20030814a:
- Bugfix: stricter GROUP reply parsing to avoid accepting negative
  values (seen on some INN with apparently corrupt overview).
- Bugfix: Initialfetch now also applies when the server resets its
  article counters (which it should never do), avoiding the check of
  thousands of articles. Reported by Reiner Steib.
- Change: double tolerance for decrease of article counters from 5 to
  10. When the number goes down by more than 10, re-fetch the group as
  though it were newly subscribed.

20030814a: Changes since 20030731a:
- Bugfix: Expire groups that are no longer in "active".
- Bugfix: Make Xref: based filters work in the XOVER phase already, to
  avoid downloading the article.
- Logging: Make filter logging more consistent.
- Documentation: Refine README*, mention syslog.conf edits.

20030731a: Changes since 20030728a:
- Bugfix: applyfilter removes filtered articles from the spool at large.

  by Reiner Steib.
- Bugfix: restore -f, -r and -n command line options for texpire.
  Reported by Michael Frotscher.
- Documentation: enhance filters.example. Courtesy of Reiner Steib.

20030728a: Changes since 20030716a:
- Bugfix: unfold header before applying filters. Reported by Reiner
  Steib.
- Feature: ln_log_stderronly (in config file) -e (on command line),
  redirects all syslog to stderr, useful with daemontools or runit.
  Requested by Clemens Fischer. Only lightly tested.

20030716a: Changes since 20030714a:
- Bugfix: posting only tried the first server. Regression in 20030714a,
  reported by Jeff Grossman.
- Documentation: Clean up fetchnews.8.in, -B, -M, -N, -P and -R
  descriptions. New sections courtesy of Jörg Lüders.

20030714a: Changes since 20030712a:
- Bugfix: fix double free() in filter handling. Reported by Robert J. Clark.

- Change: Post first, then fetch. Suggested by Jörg Lüders.

20030712a: Changes since 20030710a:
- Bugfix: Filtering by regexp was broken (inverse logic) unless
  DEBUG_FILTER was set (debugmode included the 32 flag).
  Regression introduced into 20030706a.

Changes since 20030706:
- Bugfix: LISTGROUP bugfixed, LISTGROUP - XOVER now works; no longer
  shows bogus pseudo article.
- Bugfix: all configure --with options are now --enable options, except
  --with-dmalloc.
- Cleanup: IPv6 configuration now uses a standard --enable option rather
  than env twiddling.
- Feature: Support for NOSUBSCRIBE environment variable.
  For documentation, see the ENVIRONMENT and README or README.html files.

Changes since 20030621:
- Cleanup: Support for PCRE before version 2.08 is gone, additionally,
  a version that installs "pcre-config" is required, which means you'll
  need to use PCRE 3.0 or newer.

2.0b-snapshot:
incompatible changes:
- backup.moderated is gone.
- the fqdn option is gone. Use hostname instead.
- Fix: timeout_active is back!
  This can cause "cannot stat /var/spool/news/leaf.node/:active.read: No
  such file or directory" to be logged until leafnode has succeeded to
  issue "LIST" on all its upstream servers. This message is harmless.
- IMPORTANT: leafnode now automatically appends "leafnode" to your
  sysconfdir. For backwards compatibility, ./configure will strip a
  trailing "/leafnode" or "/leafnode/" so you don't end up with your
  configuration in /etc/leafnode/leafnode/config.
- The "dontpost" configuration option is replaced by "feedtype=none".
- Debug logging to syslog and console is now only enabled if the
  debugmode figure is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), to cut down the size of
  logging in verbose mode somewhat.
- fetchnews now compares the local clock to the server's clock if the
  server supports the DATE command and complains if the two are more
  than 10 minutes apart.
- leafnode now resolves conflicts between a group name and the same name
  that only differs in upper vs. lower case, it prefers the lower-case
  version.

other changes:
- fix portability to Solaris 8 (both SunPro 6 and gcc 2.95).
- kill temp.files links for local posts, reported by Robert Marshall.
- signal handling fixes.
- fixed the timeout-goes-unnoticed bug, thanks to Richard van der Hoff.
- tries to fix the infamous "unsigned -1" corruption in groupinfo.
- build toolchain updated to automake 1.7.1/autoconf 2.54
- forward-port of only_groups_pcre option from leafnode-1.
- articles that are mailed to the moderator that don't already have a To:
  header line now get the To: header appended.
- no longer installs the "lsort" program. You can remove it from
  /usr/local/sbin/lsort
- fetchnews now logs how many articles could be filtered from pseudo
  headers generated from XOVER data already. Look for "group.name: XOVER
  N to get, M filtered" lines.
- the filterfile and applyfilter manual pages have been updated
- Add: Rnews is back!
- There is a new "only_fetch_once" option, that reads a group only from
  the first server queried that carries this group. Suggested by Jörg
  Mensmann.
- Only change permissions/owner of leafnode directories when creating
  them. Requested by Kevin Bulgrien.
- delaybody is back!  (Ralf Wildenhues)
  delaybody mode can now be enabled for all or selected groups only,
  specified by wildcard patterns with the "groupdelaybody" option.
- fetchnews revamped (Ralf Wildenhues)
  It is now possible to query all or some newsgroups only, fetch several
  articles by Message-ID and fine-tune fetching of headers and bodies
  of delaybody groups as well as articles in regular groups.
- fetchnews and rnews no longer use a two-stage approach -- the
  .overview files are updated as articles are stored, this should profit
  from caches.

2.0b8_ma10pre3.3:
- fix: texpire crashes (Ralf Wildenhues)
- fix: garbage from host name resolver (Raymond Scholz)
- fix: off-by-one error in FQDN validator (Matthias Andree)
- feature: "no_direct_spool=1": can now post in leafnode-1.9 style: only
  show locally posted articles after they have been fetched from the
  upstream. (Matthias Andree)
- feature: newsq prints now Date: and Message-ID: (Matthias Andree)
- docs: NEWS file (Matthias Andree)
- build: enable gcc warnings (Ralf Wildenhues)
- internal: getfoldedline does not try to read the continuation of a
  line that starts with a dot. (Matthias Andree)
