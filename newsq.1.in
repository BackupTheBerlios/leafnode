.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newsq [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [-cf]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR newsq
outputs a summary of news that is in leafnode's out.going, in.coming and
failed.postings news queues.
.P
In out.going, leafnode queues news that has been posted locally on your
site and not yet uploaded to the upstream news server.
.P
In in.coming, leafnode queues news destined to the
local system that it could
not store into the groups at the time it was posted (because, for
example, texpire or fetchnews were running).
.P
failed.postings carries all articles that have been rejected by upstream
servers.
.SH OPTIONS
For a description of the \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR, see
.BR leafnode (8).
.TP
.I -c
Check mode. Checks the out.going queue without printing anything. The
exit code is EXIT_SUCCESS (0) when out.going contains articles,
EX_UNAVAILABLE when no articles are spooled in out.going and
EXIT_FAILURE when there was an error.
.TP
.I -f
Print list of article bodies marked for download by delaybody mode. No
headers or summaries will be printed, the format is the group name, a
colon (:), the article number, a space, and the message ID in angle
brackets.
.TP
.I -h
Print a short help and print the exit codes used in -c mode. They
are system-specific and should not change when updating leafnode, but
can change on updating operating systems, although this should rarely
happen.
.SH SECURITY

.I news
group. Do
.B not
install it set-user-id anything!
