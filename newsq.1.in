.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR newsq
outputs a summary of news that is in leafnode's out.going, in.coming and
failed.postings news queues.
.P
In out.going, leafnode queues news that has been posted locally on your
site and not yet uploaded to the upstream news server.
.P
In in.coming, leafnode queues news destined to the
local system that it could
not store into the groups at the time it was posted (because, for
example, texpire or fetchnews were running).
.P
failed.postings carries all articles that have been rejected by upstream
servers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -c
Check mode. Checks the out.going queue without printing anything. The

EX_UNAVAILABLE when no articles are spooled in out.going and
EXIT_FAILURE when there was an error.
.TP
.I -h
Help. Print a short help and print the exit codes used in -c mode. They
are system-specific and should not change after updating leafnode.
