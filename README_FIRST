INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
---------------------

1. all server files for servers that don't have a port number have been
   renamed. These are files below interesting.groups and now always have
   their port number attached, even if it's the default of 0.  This
   simplifies the code.

2. active.read is gone. It's replaced by leaf.node/last:server.name:port
   instead which allows for implicit (automatic) recovery from a server
   failure when getting all newsgroups.
