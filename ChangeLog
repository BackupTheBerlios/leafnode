History of 2.0b3 -- changes since 2.0b2:

fetchnews:
=========

271000: yesterday we did a number of "if ( port == 119)" constructs.
	Only today we realized that, if the default port is used,
	"port" is set to zero. Made the proper changes.
261000: made several changes to accommodate retrieving news from the
	same server on different ports. Unfortunately I have no idea
	any more who sent me the patch.
261000: nntpactive(): To avoid a compiler warning, we let strftime()
	produce a four-digit year; in the next line, we skip the
	first two digits, though. Code written by Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
261000: doxover(): the generated pseudoheader now also contains a
	Bytes: header. Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
261000: getarticle(): killfilter() was employed regardless of the
	filtermode. Bug spotted by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.

libutil:
=======

271000: artutil.c: store() didn't initialize the static variable cg
	which might have resulted in a core dump. Fixed. Problem
	reported by Stefan Fleiter <stefan.fleiter@gmx.de>.
271000: made strdup.c a separate file. Unfortunately it doesn't compile
	at all, and I don't know why.
271000: added a vsnprintf() by Theo de Raadt with BSD license that
	also contains snprintf(). Therefore I removed both the
	snprintf() and vsnprintf() from miscutil.c. This fixes the
	problem outlined below.
261000: artutil: storearticle() did not honour "create_all_links". Patch
	by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
261000: configutil: filtermode now set by default to (FM_XOVER & FM_HEAD) .
251000: miscutil: inserted a very crude replacement for vsnprintf()
	using vsprintf() to make Leafnode compile on OSF1. It is clear
	that vsprintf() is prone to buffer overflow attacks.

nntpd:
=====

261000: fopenart(): if a local group is visited, no pseudoarticle is
	present. Suggested by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
251000: did not compile with IPV6 because the logging of connections
	always assumed IPV4 addresses. Error reported by Mark Brown
	<broonie@sirena.org.uk>. Very crude fix by omitting any
	reporting if compiled with IPV6.

rnews:
=====

261000: rnews didn't know local groups. Patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.

Miscellaneous:
=============

261000: leafnode.h: included <sys/types.h> to account for "size_t".
	Suggested by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
261000: removed miscellaneous references to COPYING. Noted first by
	Phil Hunt <philh@comuno.freeserve.co.uk>.
251000: leafnode.h: added vsnprintf() prototype
251000: leafnode.h: size_t may only occur in a file after stdio.h has
	been included, otherwise gcc on OSF1 will barf. Error reported
	by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

History of 2.0b2 -- changes since 2.0b1:

libutil:
=======

251000: xoverutil: gfixxover(): argument of isspace() was not casted
	to unsigned char. Reported by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
251000: miscutil: snprintf(): unused variable rval was present.
	Reported by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
251000: artutil: mgetheader(): argument of isspace() was not casted to
	unsigned char; instead the result of isspace() was casted. Bug
	reported by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.

nntpd:
=====
251000: list(): argument of tolower() was not casted to unsigned char.
	Reported by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.

Miscellaneous:
=============

251000: leafnode.h: added a declaration of snprintf() for systems
	which don't provide is (snprintf() is defined in miscutil.c).
	Bug reported by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
251000: README: added a section on deinstallation. Suggested by
	Juergen Salk <juergen.salk@gmx.de>.
251000: Makefile.in: if no pcrelib is installed, "make uninstall" or
	"make uninstall-bins" will now remove pcre.7 as well. Patch
	provided by Juergen Salk <juergen.salk@gmx.de>.
251000: Makefile.in: "make install" now also creates
	/var/spool/news/local.groups . Suggested by Stefan Fleiter
	<stefan.fleiter@gmx.de>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

History of 2.0b1 -- changes since 1.9.4:

applyfilter:
===========

181000: for some reason, applyfilter doesn't work.
181000: applyfilter was always called with argv[1]. Now it is called
	with argv[optind] which ensures that the newsgroup is correct.
080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
080900: adjusted main() to new format of readconfig().
120300: fixed call of lockfile_exists() to accommodate new format. Patch
	by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
010899: terminate if filterfile is not present. Bug reported by
	Marcus Szumigala <MSzumigala@gmx.net>.
210799: fix .overview file after killing articles

fetchnews:
=========

181000: doxover(): articles were actually not marked for download even
	if filtering was successful
181000: doxover(): an essential piece of code was missing to assemble an
	article header from the xover line. Fixed.
171000: doxhdr(): the message ids are now not logged anymore
131000: doxover(): output of XOVER not logged any more
121000: two new global variables, groupfetched and groupkilled, to count
	fetched and killed articles per group.
121000: doxover() loses one parameter which wasn't used anyway.
280900: -F works again through new function getconffile().
270900: switched back to reading config file *before* evaluating options.
	However, this breaks -F.
270900: managed to change the behavior of -S so that usernames and
	passwords in the config file are used but servers *only* in
	the config file are not.
270900: new function do_server() which incorporates some functionality
	of the former main().
140900: moved supersede() into artutil.c. Patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
140900: checkinteresting() should only be called if fetchnews is
	invoked without -n. Fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
140900: F: was missing in the getopt() call. Reported by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
080900: added option "-M message-id" to retrieve only a single message-id
080900: added option "-F configfile" to read from a different configuration
	file
080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
080900: adjusted main() to new format of readconfig()
060900: if "LIST NEWSGROUPS news.group.name" does not work for the first
	new group, no second attempt to get a groupname is made. Suggested
	by Carlos Robinson <cerobinson@teleline.es>.
060900: some minor changes in main() and getfirstlast() (mostly removal
	of debugging messages).
040800: implemented catching of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to increase or
	decrease verbosity on the fly. Patch by Colin Brough
	<Colin.Brough@btinternet.com>.
040800: implemented the new locking mechanism for fetchnews, to avoid
	getting into troubles with the nntpd. Written by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
040800: new function checkforpostings(). This avoids connecting with any
	upstream server if there is nothing to post and fetchnews is
	invoked with -P.
280700: new function freeserverlist(), needed by main().
280700: main(): regrouped some invokements.
280700: main(): removed unused variable "usesupplement".
280700: main(): implemented -S option, after a patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: main(): the configuration must be read before parsing the options.
	Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: getgroup(): since the return value of getfirstlast() can be
	negative, the variable x containing it cannot be unsigned. Bug
	fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: getarticle(): free used memory. Patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: getarticle(): Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> added support for
	Supersedes. TODO: this should only be conditionally switched on.
280700: getfirstlast(): if the server does have an empty group, return
	FALSE. Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: getfirstlast(): if more "extraarticles" are requested than there
	are articles on the server, the function became confused (because
	negative numbers were generated). Fixed by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
280700: sigcatch() also catches SIGALRM now. Patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
140700: moved age() to filterutil.c
140700: doxover(): moved killing of maxage, maxlines, minlines, maxbytes
	and maxcrosspost into filterutil.c. This has the advantage that
	it is possible to apply these criteria in a newsgroup-specific
	fashion.
140700: getgroup(): removed the check to interesting.groups. Instead,
	we check all groups once at the startup of fetchnews (and
	texpire).
120700: new function doxhdr() which is called if there are no filter
	settings for a newsgroup. This should improve the speed because
	in that case only Message-IDs and not complete headers have to
	be transferred. Based on a posting to de.comm.software.newsserver
	by Juergen Strohmayer <usenet@bigfoot.de>.
010700: nntpactive(): since some wierd news servers have not implemented
	LIST ACTIVE, use LIST instead
120300: doxover(): removed strtok() code from 180100 because it didn't
	work at all. Replaced it with the original code of 170100 and
	re-inserted the bugfix from 230200. This code may still not be
	fully correct.
120300: fixed calls of lockfile_exists() to accommodate new format.
	Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
040300: insertgroup(): if fetchnews -f was called, creation time was
	not set to 0. Bug discovered and fixed by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
230200: doxover(): when maxage was set to 0, all articles were killed.
	Bug reported by Johannes Stezenbach.
130200: nntpactive(): new groups reported by NEWGROUPS were not inserted
	in the groupinfo file (and would have been inserted with a wrong
	date). Bug found and fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
180100: rewrote doxover() based on code by Vladimir Dozen
	<dozen@do-labs.spb.ru>.
130199: if "LIST NEWSGROUPS" returned just "215" without any text, fetchnews
	became confused. Reported by Pasqualino Casciano
	<pasqualino.casciano@stud.lrz-muenchen.de>.
130100: ismsgidonserver(): waited for more lines after a 430 error message.
	Bug discovered and fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
080100: doxover(): more informative error message if XOVER fails
080100: doxover() returns now the correct values if all articles are
	already downloaded.
010100: ismsgidonserver() now uses HEAD instead of STAT since STAT
	implementation is buggy with some nntp servers (problem
	reported by Qing Liu <liu@math.u-bordeaux.fr>).
211299: automatic unsubscription of groups got lost in the rewriting
	process. Fixed (I used the leafnode-1.9.8 variant).
291199: ismsgidonserver() re-written to care for buggy nntpcache (at least
	some versions of nntpcache reply to STAT <msgid> with "223", even
	if there is no article <msgid>).
251199: lockfile is unlocked after writing active file since we don't
	need to lock for writing overview files (at least I have not
	encountered any locking problems with overview files so far,
	and the nntpd doesn't lock either).
181199: removed all the old code since the new one was working quite
	satisfactorily as of 151199.
181199: case of newsgroups is not changed anymore.
151199: mgetheader(): various additions of globalfetched and globalkilled
	made by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
151199: mgetheader(): space allocated for pseudo headers was not initialized
	properly. Bug found and patched by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
091199: getarticle(): before writing Xref: headers, an empty line was
	inserted. Bug found and patched by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
091199: getarticle(): fopenmsgid() was called with the message id, not
	the pathname. Bug found and patched by Joerg Dietrich 
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
091199: getarticle(): Xref: from upstream header should not be saved.
	Bug found and patched by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
061199: filtering on maxlines and minlines did not always work. Bug found
	and patched by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
041199: (old) getgroup(): if a header was not found, fetchnews would segfault.
	Bug found and fixed by Arkadiusz Mi¶kiewicz <misiek@misiek.eu.org>.
	(I thought I had fixed this already. Apparently not.)
011199: mgetheader() did look for headers at the end of the line instead of
	the beginning. Fixed.
011199: age() now checks whether it gets a full "Date:" header or only the
	date without the header.
011199: doxover() debugged with ddd uncovered several small errors which
	prevented the new getgroup() from running properly.
271099: made a few changes to updateactive(): when atime of active.read was
	newer than current date, it was not changed. Now, fetchnews also
	produces a warning if this happens.
251099: made a few changes to (old)getgroup()
161099: Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> fixed a bug in doxover() which
	prevented xoverlines from being parsed correctly.
081099: getbody() deleted.
081099: rewrote getmarked() because it was seriously f...ed up. It now
	uses the new function getarticle() instead of getbody().
061099: introduced new #define OLDVERSION which is set for the old version
	and should be unset when trying to compile (and test) the new version
	which still contains a gazillion of bugs.
061099: delposted(): now we delete everything that was created in out.going
	before fetchnews started instead of making lists. Saves memory and
	is conceptually simpler (except if somebody has changed the clock
	between the actual posting event and the call of fetchnews).
031099: postarticles(): added a missing fclose() and a missing closedir()
	when a timeout occurred during posting. Bug reported by Brian
	Ewins <brian.ewins@bt.com>.
220999: nntpactive(): if upstream server understands XGTITLE, new groups
	and their descriptions were not entered in active file. Fixed
	(hopefully). Bug discovered by Carsten Bobek <c.bobek@gmx.de>.
140999: fixed a bug in getparam(): numerical parameters were not evaluated
	correctly
120999: getfirstlast(): now properly yields parameters
230899: continued the "big rewrite". New functions are:
	- getarticles(): get all articles in a newsgroup using overlapping
	  NNTP commands.
	- getarticle(): getting the single article. This function is not
	  written yet.
	- legalheaders(): check if a message has all legal headers present
	- getmsgid(): extract message-id from headers in memory
180899: usage(): program was still called "fetch". Reported by Christian
	Fertig <fertig@informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>.
180899: oldgetgroup(): if there were more than one blank between header
	and header contents, the contents were mangled (not properly
	truncated, that is). Bug reported by Gerd R. Greye
	<gerd.greye@pironet.netsurf.de>.
050899: removed all calls of tgetaline() since it did not work as
	intended.
270799: getgroup(): xover header are now filtered.
260799: added check for message ids in getgroup().
260799: messed around with processupstream() which didn't read its written
	data properly
250799: started the big rewrite of getgroup() (old getgroup() is called
	oldgetgroup() in the meanwhile). New functions are:
	- getfirstlast()
	  find out which are the first and last articles to get
	- doxover()
	  get headers with XOVER, filter for various things and store them
	  if delaybody is used
	- fopenmsgid()
	  store an article under /var/spool/news/message.id/ and create
	  subdirectories if needed
	- getarticle()
	  get the article. Not written yet. May be split into gethead()
	  and getbody() (not sure yet).
240799: handling of long ints was still incorrect in getgroup(). Fixed.
230799: fetchnews now also catches SIGTERM.
210799: getgroup() returns now unsigned long instead of int
210799: processupstream(): declared newserver as "unsigned long" to improve
	compatibility
210799: activated -H and -B switches (most of the code was already present
	in 1.9.4)

libutil:
=======

231000: filterutil: messed around with killfilter() a bit more. Now it
	seems to work.
231000: filterutil: readfilter(): pcre_compile() was called with wrong
	variable "l" instead of "value". Fixed by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
231000: filterutil: killfilter(): parameters for call of findinheaders()
	were switched.  Switched back by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
231000: filterutil: killfilter(): no check whether findinheaders() found
	something before calling strtol(). This could lead to crashes.
	Fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
231000: filterutil: findinheaders() should not match on the whole line
	but only on the length of "needle". Fixed by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
181000: configutil: removed obsolete filter variables
181000: miscutil: parseopt() does not log options any more
181000: xoverutil: getxoverline() inserted tabs into the xoverline if
	they were present in multiline headers. This confused texpire.
171000: activutil: if insertgroup was called with a description of NULL,
	it would crash because strdup(NULL) was called. Now "desc" is
	checked beforehand.
131000: miscutil: getoptarg() now uses findopt().
131000: miscutil: new function findopt() which determines whether an
	option is present on the command line without using getopt().
131000: miscutil: renamed getconffile() to getoptarg() and allowed the
	specification of the option. This makes the function more
	universal.
280900: miscutil: new function getconffile() allows parsing of command
	line for a config file without using getopt(). Therefore, we
	can still use getopt() after reading the config file, thus making
	it possible to override settings in the config file.
280900: miscutil: getaline() now uses GNU getline() if present. First
	suggested by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
270900: configutil: readconfig(): added "debugmode" option again because
	I frequently forgot to type -D at the command line.
270900: configutil: readconfig(): made servers again a global variable.
	I am surprised that the original code had apparently worked
	occasionally.
190900: artutil: insertgroup() sets count for each group to 0.
190900: artutil: readactive() sets count for each group to 0.
140900: xoverutil: getxoverline() now preserves atime and utime of a file.
	Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>. I am not sure
	whether this is really needed because getxoverline() should
	ideally be only called once - but it makes things more robust.
140900: artutil: storearticle() now can and will supersede articles.
	Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>. I am not sure
	whether this is desirable; at least one should be able to
	configure it.
140900: artutil: added supersede() from fetchnews. Patch by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
080900: miscutil: parseopt() modified to adjust new option -F.
080900: configutil: readconfig() now takes two parameters to make it
	possible to read different config files
040900: miscutil: getaline() modified according to Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
300800: activutil: found the newly introduced bug in readactive(). We
	accidentally replaced also the last NUL byte with a space which
	was stupid (and it was pure luck that it did not cause segfaults
	so far).
290800: activutil: readactive() threw around with complaints about
	truncated groupinfo files. Fixed a first bug which might cause
	crashes because we wrote into unallocated memory. This does
	not fix the complaints, however.
240800: miscutil: getaline() still had problems with NUL bytes. Now these
	are replaced with spaces.
040800: xoverutil: getxover() could not handle negative return values from
	findxover which resulted in coredumps (the variable was declared as
	"unsigned"). Fixed.
040800: miscutil: findinlist(): if "needle" is a NULL pointer, return
	NULL.
030800: xoverutil: findxover() now returns (again?) -1 on error. (Since
	an array can have an object indexed with 0, this object would
	have never returned.)
030800: activutil: fixed a bug in insertgroup(): the description was not
	strdup()ed, leading to possible memory overwrites by other things.
	This was only discovered when implementing local groups.
280700: configutil: readconfig() now returns 0 in case of success and a
	positive error number in case of failure which then can be
	translated by the calling program (with strerror()). This should
	reduce the number of inquiries concerning unreadable config files
	somewhat.
280700: configutil: readconfig() now returns servers as parameter, if
	possible. Advantage: one global variable less.
240700: miscutil: getaline(): doubling bytes again in an exponential
	fashion; in addition patch for NUL bytes, provided by Matthias
	Andree <matthias.andree@gmx.de>.
170700: miscutil: initvars(): messed around with setuid() and getuid().
	It should now again be possible to install fetchnews setuid news.
	This ability was lost in the transition from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8.
170700: miscutil: getaline() would double the line length when reading
	incomplete lines. Now it allocates bytes in a linear fashion.
140700: filterutil: new functions findinheader() and age() (the latter
	comes virtually unchanged from fetchnews.c)
140700: filterutil: changes in newfilter(), readfilter() and most
	massively in killfilter() to accommodate group-wise "maxage",
	"maxlines", "minlines", "maxbytes" and "maxcrosspost".
140700: localutil: islocalgroup() declaration changed to remove a warning
140700: miscutil: new function checkinteresting() goes through the
	interesting.groups directory and deletes everything that is
	not interesting.
120700: nntputil: AUTHINFO USER and AUTHINFO PASS are now logged on
	the debug facility. Username and password are, of course, not
	logged.
050700: miscutil: nntp traffic is only logged if programs are invoked
	with at least two -D.
050700: miscutil: islocal() replaced with islocalgroup() in localutil
050700: new file localutil.c
010700: xoverutil: removed stripspace() completely from the code that
	creates the overview lines. This means that leading and trailing
	blanks are not removed any more in any header line, nor are
	consecutive blanks compressed. Suggested by Thomas Zajic
	<zlatko@gmx.at>.
010700: miscutil: added snprintf() from leafnode-1.9.14.
010700: activutil: insertgroup() gets an additional parameter containing
	the group description. We need this for local groups.
010700: activutil: removed a superfluous "#include <string.h>"
190300: activutil: mergeactive() now sets the "name" of the first
	unused slot to NULL. Suggested by Claude Michel <cpjm@free.fr>.
	(This may or may not cause a small memory leak.)
120300: configutil: included some strategically placed "debug = 0" and
	"debug = debugmode" lines in readconfig() to avoid logging the
	whole file every time.
120300: xoverutil: new function gfixxover() fixes overview lines for
	each group in a comma-delimited string. Written by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: miscutil: new function islocal() checking whether a group is
	local. Written by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: miscutil: isinteresting() rewritten for local groups by
	Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: miscutil: lockfile_exists now uses fcntl() to check for
	already running instances of fetchnews (or other programs in
	the leafnode suite). Rewritten by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: artutil: now function lookup_xref(). This function looks up a
	group in an xref line and returns the article number if the
	group is present, otherwise NULL. Written by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: activutil: fakeactive() now also checks local groups. Patch by
	Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
100300: artutil: storearticle() was still broken. Massive patch by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>. (Joerg had submitted a similar
	patch before but I apparently misplaced it.)
040300: artutil: fgetheader() will now remove the : by itself even
	if not given in the "header" parameter.
040300: activutil: insertgroup() changed creation times of already
	existing groups, causing them to be displayed as new. Bug
	independently fixed by Johannes Stezenbach and Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
040300: activutil: helpfindgroup() modified which speeds up the time to find
	a group. Prompted by benchmarking the code to some code written by
	Tony de Haan <tony@iae.nl>.
040300: miscutil: new functions stringlistlen() and cmdlinetolist(),
	written by Andreas Ferber <aferber@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de>.
230200: xoverutil: getxoverline() now ignores Lines: headers and computes
	the correct number by itself. Suggested by Johannes Stezenbach.
220200: miscutil: replaced the fnmatch() code in ngmatch() with Rich
	Salz's original wildmat().
130200: activutil: fixed small bug introduced yesterday
120200: activutil: Lloyd Zusman <ljz@asfast.com> discovered and plugged
	a memory hole in readactive(): new function freeactive().
290100: activutil: changegroupdesc() crashed when receiving NULL pointers.
	Bug fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
290100: miscutil: ngmatch(): case-insensitive regexp now indeed terminates
	with '\0'. Bug fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
180100: activutil: writeactive() does not write empty records any more.
	Code taken from 1.9.10b2.
180100: readactive: first and last article set to 1 if they are 0.
180100: xoverutil: improved code for deletion of illegal articles after
	bug reports by Andy Piper <squiggle@ukgateway.net>.
080100: xoverutil: return value of mkstemp() was tested in the wrong way.
	Fixed.
080100: activutil: fakeactive() successfully debugged. This means that all
	functions in activutil.c have been successfully tested.
080100: activutil: helpfindgroup() now uses signed longs instead of
	unsigned ones. This solves a lot of problems.
080100: activutil: insertgroup() could not deal with already existing
	groups. Fixed.
080100: activutil: readactive() missed a free( buf ). Fixed.
070100: activutil: fakeactive() now disregards subgroups starting with
	digits (this still doesn't help against group names which consist
	entirely of digits, such as alt.2600)
070100: activutil_new moved to activutil
070100: moved isinteresting() from activutil to miscutil.
070100: miscutil: removed "active = NULL" from initvars().
060100: activutil: completely rewritten to use arrays instead of trees,
	unfinished version stored in activutil_new.c. readactive()
	and writeactive() have already been tested successfully.
060100: configutil: no more "debugmode" parameter. Use -D instead.
060100: miscutil: ngmatch() converts a pattern that does not contain
	ranges into a case-insensitive pattern before using fnmatch()
	on it.
060100: filterutil: implemented more intricate filtering rules. This
	involved a major rewrite of readfilter() and dofilter() (now
	called killfilter()) and the new functions newfilter(),
	selectfilter() and freefilter().
040100: miscutil: replaced ngmatch() with the version from leafnode-1.9.7.
	This makes string comparison sometimes case-insensitive and fixes
	a bug reported by Daniel Barron <daniel@jadeb.com>: in config.h.in,
	HAVE_FNMATCH is defined; but in miscutil.c, HAVE_FNMATCH_H was used.
030100: miscutil: initvars(): setreuid() and setregid() are replaced
	by setuid() and setgid() if possible. Patch by Bruno Rohee
	<rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
030100: xoverutil: getxover(): open(mktemp()) replaced with mkstemp()
	if possible. Patch by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
011299: configutil: readconfig(): parameter was missing if an username
	was found in a file without a server. Reported by Bruno Rohee
	<rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
251199: xoverutil: getxoverline() now also allows tabs behind the colon
	in headers. Problem reported by Radoslaw Gancaraz <r_g@priv2.onet.pl>.
221199: miscutil: chdirgroup(): tolower() now casts its argument like
	isspace() etc.
221199: miscutil: lockfile_exists(): getpid() now casted to int.
191199: activutil: readactive(): if reading is truncated, st.st_size is now
	cast to int. Submitted by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
191199: activutil: helpwriteactive(): g->age casted to unsigned long.
	Submitted by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
191199: activutil: readactive(): when groupinfo was not a regular file,
	leafnode would crash. Bug discovered and fixed by Bruno Rohee
	<rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
181199: activutil: writeactive() does not change case of newsgroups anymore.
181199: miscutil: removed lowercase() (not necessary anymore).
181199: miscutil: made the replacement code for fnmatch() case-insensitive.
091199: filterutil: dofilter() returned a hit when no filter file was
	present. Bug found and fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
091199: xoverutil: hopefully the last patch (this time to findxover() which
	would be unable to find certain articles and segfault with others).
	Bug found by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
081199: xoverutil: some more patching in getxover() to get everything right.
071199: xoverutil: spent about four hours hunting a bug which lead to a
	segfault (xcount was set 1 too high in getxover() which resulted
	in the crash of writexover()). I have no idea when this problem
	was introduced as I had not encountered any problems with crashes
	since 011199.
031199: miscutil: daylight savings time was not correctly honoured in
	rfctime(). Bug reported by Diedrich Ehlerding
	<diedrich.ehlerding@t-online.de>.
011199: xoverutil: writexover() would always forget to write the overview
	record for the latest article.
011199: configutil: when setting the core limit, the struct is now first
	initialized by calling getrlimit().
011199: miscutil: initvars() now always sets the access rights for
	/var/spool/news/out.going to rwsr-xr-x.
281099: miscutil: patched rfctime() to remove unnecessary variables (leftovers
	from leafnode-1.4) and to accommodate new member of struct tm, based
	on a patch by Michael Mauch <michael.mauch@gmx.de>
231099: configutil: removed "newsrc" option
231099: configutil: new option "pseudoarticle" to use an arbitrary
	pseudoarticle
091099: miscutil: new version appendtolist() adds a new entry to a
	stringlist. Replaces lots of code at different places in
	fetchnews.c.
220999: activutil: a closedir() was missing in fakeactive(). Bug discovered
	and fixed by Brian Ewins <Brian.Ewins@gssec.bt.co.uk>.
200999: xoverutil: fixed a bug in getxover() which was introduced on
	290899 and caused fetch to crash (a pointer was freed twice).
300899: artutil: applied a patch from Greg Weeks <greg@durendal.tzo.com>
	to storearticle() which makes rnews work properly in pipes.
290899: xoverutil: rewrote getxover() completely. The .overview file
	is now also written if files are deleted. Furthermore, there
	should be no more memory shortage if there are articles with
	very different numbers in a newsgroup. (This bug was first
	reported by Giulio <giuliox@tin.it>.)
	New functions:
	- findxover() and helpfindxover(): find the index entry for an
	  article number. findxover() is also called by nntpd.
	- _compxover(): sorts the .overview file with qsort(3).
280899: xoverutil: removed some error messages from getxover() which
	were mostly bogus (because you got them if a newsgroup started
	with a digit).
280899: nntputil is included into libutil.a again
240899: nntputil is not included into libutil.a anymore
240899: nntputil: rewrote putaline() (needs no global lineout anymore)
230899: filterutil: dofilter() gets article number as additional parameter
190899: xoverutil: getxover(): would try to get xover information from
	directories starting with digits. Bug reported by a number of
	people, among them Jeff Grossman <jeff@stikman.com>.
190899: xoverutil: getxover(): the .overview file could be left open if
	some other condition than its opening failed. Fixed.
090899: activutil: isinteresting() missed a few closedir() calls
050899: nntputil: tgetaline() removed
050899: configutil: new global variable "filtermode" which cannot yet
	be set. Will allow choosing between filtering xover headers or
	real article headers.
050899: configutil: servers now logged to LOG_DEBUG, not LOG_INFO
010899: filterutil: filterlist is initially NULL
010899: filterutil: readfilter() now returns FALSE if filterfile could not
	be read.
250799: filterutil: compiling filter verbose message switched off again
240799: activutil: isinteresting() now uses readdir() instead of stat
	(i.e. it will not access the inode any more); the parameter
	is now declared "const".
220799: xoverutil: getxover() checked wrong condition if a file was
	"illegal". Bug discovered and fixed by Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: xoverutil: new function writexover().
210799: changed type of xfirst/xlast to unsigned long.
210799: moved initialization of xfirst/xlast/xover structure from miscutil.c
	to xoverutil.c (declaration).
210799: artutil: switched various format strings from int to unsigned long
210799: activutil: switched format in helpwriteactive() to unsigned long
210799: configutil: switched artlimit and initiallimit from int to unsigned
	long.
210799: activutil: readactive(): initialized desc to NULL. Patch by
	Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: configutil: readconfig(): initialized p and q to NULL. Patch by
	Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: miscutil: declared namelen as unsigned int instead of int. Patch
	by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: nntputil: removed a register declaration from nntpconnect() and
	made two variables static (removes pgcc warnings and solves some
	ominous problems). Patch by Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: xoverutil: do not expire files starting with '.'. Based on a
	patch by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: configutil: new parameter "newsrc" (not used yet)
210799: filterutil: compiling filters is shown when being verbose

newsq:
=====

080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
291199: should now also print correctly if sizeof(off_t) == 8
221199: #include <sys/types.h> (required by HP/UX and possibly others)

nntpd:
=====

190900: dogroup() now indeed returns the approximate number of articles
	in the group, not just (g->last - g->first) .
180900: changed doselectedheader() to return 420 if no article is in the
	specified range.
170900: Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> fixed broken doselectedheader().
170900: Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> changed all calls of
		ngmatch( l->string, pattern )
	to
		ngmatch( (const char*)&(l->string), pattern ).
	This is necessary because a stringlist entry l is not a struct of
	two pointers (one to the next entry, the other to the string) but
	contains the actual string.
140900: removed some more superfluous \r\n in various nntpprintf() calls
	(patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>).
130900: doxover(): XOVER for an empty range returned 224, not 420.
	Fixed.
130900: doxover(): XOVER returned all articles, not only the current one.
	Fixed.
080900: new option -F to read from different config file.
080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
080900: adjusted main() to new format of readconfig().
040900: doselectedheader(): "XHDR [header] <message-id>" always returned
	the first header of strlen(header) in the file, without checking
	for identity. Bug reported by Andrzej Radecki <radecki@wpk.p.lodz.pl>.
080800: doselectedheader(): now also can return a Newsgroups: header for
	pseudoarticles if "XHDR Newsgroups" is requested. Suggested by
	Karen Nakamura <mail@gpsy.com> because MT Newswatcher needs it.
040800: new function gmtoff(), written by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>,
	calculates a reliable difference between localtime and GMT. Some
	help from Oisin Curtin <ocurtin@usa.net> and Radoslaw Gancarz
	<r_g@priv2.onet.pl>.
030800: dohelp(): added "list overview.fmt"
030800: dolist(): removed a few superfluous \r\n
030800: main(): added invocation of readlocalgroups(). This makes local
	groups work with the nntpd.
030800: nntpprintf(): now fflush() stdout after printing. This seems to
	fix a problem of incomplete threading in tin.
050700: removed the "justaftergroup" mechanism. Instead, groups are now
	marked if one of the following NNTP commands is encountered:
	- GROUP if the group was already interesting
	- LISTGROUP
	- XHDR
	- XPAT
	- XOVER
	- ARTICLE
050700: dogroup() now marks a group as interesting if it was already in
	the list of interesting groups, but not otherwise. This solves
	some problems with Knode. Suggested by Christian Gebauer
	<gebauer@bigfoot.com>.
050700: calls to islocal() replaced with calls to islocalgroup().
010700: dopost(): if owndn is set, it is now also included in the Path:
	(not only used for the message ID). Suggested by Mark Brown
	<broonie@tardis.ed.ac.uk>.
310300: donewnews() and donewgroups(): external variable timezone does
	not exist on BSD. Replaced with tm_gmtoff.
120300: dopost(): articles are now immediately sorted into the spool.
	This is achieved by fork()ing. nntpd ignores SIGCHLD therefore
	(in main()).
	One problem is that now fetchnews and the nntpd cannot be
	run at the same time (?).
120300: dogroup() now always calls rereadactive() before looking for the
	groupname. Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
120300: markinterest() returns immediately (and does not touch files in
	$SPOOLDIR/interesting.groups) if a group is local.
100300: NEWGROUPS and NEWNEWS now only care for timezone if the client does
	not explicitely request "GMT". Patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.
040300: parser() now also understands PAT in addition to XPAT.
040300: dohelp() adjusted for NEWNEWS capabilities.
040300: new function donewnews() to support NEWNEWS. This function is
	still somewhat crude in that it does not care for timezones.
040300: NEWGROUPS now also cares for timezone. Patch by Johannes
	Stezenbach.
040300: Andreas Ferber <aferber@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de> merged
	doxpat() and doxhdr() into new function doselectedheader().
	doxpat() and doxhdr() remain as small wrappers.
270200: fprintpseudobody(): now contains new URL for leafnode. Reported
	by Thomas Bader <thomasb@trash.net>.
230200: dohelp() and dolist() adjusted for new XPAT capabilities.
230200: new function doxpat(), written by Andreas Ferber
	<aferber@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de>. This enables the nntpd
	to understand the XPAT command.
130200: removed shadow code from doauthinfo() (does not work because
	nntpd never runs as root).
160100: doxhdr() now returns (none) if asked for XHDR REFERENCES of an
	article. Suggested by Ted Marston <ted@nowtsfree.freeserve.co.uk>;
	increases compatibility with xrn.
080100: donewgroups() and list() do not traverse trees any more but just
	zoom through the whole array of "active". This avoids a lot of
	recursive invoking of functions and therefore may be faster.
030100: donewgroups(): some buggy newsreaders send date in the form YYYMMDD.
	We now parse these dates successfully. Bug first reported by
	Nick Drage <nick-drage@gmx.ch>.
211299: markinterest() changed both mtime and atime if file was already
	present. Fixed. (A problem with the expiry mechanism had been
	reported by several people but it was quite difficult to track it
	down.)
101299: if the domainname is set in the config file, it is now also used
	in the Path:. Suggested by Klaus Berger <klausmartin.berger@gmx.net>.
011299: dopost(): if spoolfile could not be opened, argument was missing
	in syslog() call. Reported by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
251199: dopost() now also allows tabs behind the colon of headers.
181199: case of newsgroups is not changed anymore.
041199: parser() now also skips leading spaces.
011199: removed rereadactive() calls from parser() and put them into
	dolist() and dogroup(). This should save a little time.
231099: new function fprintpseudobody(): print body of an arbitrary
	pseudoarticle and do certain replacements
171099: donewgroups(): fixed a bug with the year 2000 (centuries were not
	handled properly). Reported by Michael Schuetz
	<michael.schuetz@tu-clausthal.de>.
171099: main(): nntpd did not complain if it could not read configuration
	file. Bug reported by Alexander Rudyk <alexrudyk@arnet.de>.
081099: dopost(): leafnode now doesn't accept postings if headers are
	longer than 1000 chars. It is not very strict, e.g. it doesn't
	check for multiline headers. (IMO, it shouldn't care at all
	and in fact is capable of transferring headers of arbitrary
	length, but several users requested this "feature".) Requested by,
	among others, Diedrich Ehlerding <Diedrich.Ehlerding@t-online.de>.
081099: fixed a bug in markdownload(). For some reason, local article
	numbers were logged, not message-ids. I have no idea when this
	bug crept in, but it explains the long number of complaints about
	the delaybody function not working properly.
031099: fixed a typo in the pseudoarticle (found by Jeffrey Goldberg,
	<J.Goldberg@cranfield.ac.uk>)
240999: added syslog connection logging (patch by Brent J. Nordquist,
	<brent-nordquist@bethel.edu>)
220999: parser(): if an unknown command was received, the nntpd sent an
	empty line in addition to the "500" reply (probably introduced
	on 260799). Fixed.
260799: parser(): if command line length == 0, now continue silently (works
	better with Netscape?). Possible problem reported by Manfred
	Haertel <Manfred.Haertel@rz-online.de>.
260799: some small changes by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
260799: new function nntpprintf(), written by Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: implemented AUTHINFO USER and AUTHINFO PASS, based on /etc/passwd
	or /etc/shadow. With some help from a patch for PAM by Mark Brown
	<broonie@tardis.ed.ac.uk>.
	Problem: if one uses /etc/shadow, authentification will fail because
	nntpd is running as uid news and therefore cannot access the
	shadowed password file.
210799: declared artno as unsigned long (not long). Patch by Matthias
	Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
210799: fopenpseudoart: article number now unsigned long. Patch by
	Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.

rnews:
=====

(rnews was originally written for a planned 1.10 version and has on
 210799 become part of 2.0.)

080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
120300: fixed call of lockfile_exists() to accommodate new format. Patch
	by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
100300: some patches to avoid full logging of articles in rnews (by
	Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>). According to him, rnews
	does not work in pipes yet.
171299: uncompressfile(): replaced exit() with _exit().
210799: rnews included into version 2.0 (does not compile successfully yet,
	because decompression and xoverfile fixing don't work yet)
270699: copyfile() moved to miscutil.c (patch by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>)
100699: rnews did not work properly with directories. The reasons were
        twofold: first, rnews refused to work with relative directories;
	second, rnews didn't account for chdir()s used when storing the
	article (with storearticle()). Bugs described and fixed by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
030699: copyfile() would try to read after the end of news batches. Bug
	detected and fixed by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
030699: copyfile(): renamed variable "total" to "copied" to clarify its
	use.
120499: rnews always wanted to read something from stdin. Fixed.
120499: rnews now properly recognizes when decompression failed and removes
	temp files
110499: rnews can now also read stuff from stdin
020499: first working version of rnews

texpire:
=======

231000: save_thread(): Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> removed a bug
	introduced by me probably on 180800.
190900: dogroup() failed if there was (for whatever reason) no .overview
	file. Now, if no .overview file can be found, getxover() is
	invoked.
140900: getxover() is invoked at the end of a run.
140900: threading now is only ensured down to a certain depth defined by
	THREADSAFETY. Patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
080900: new option -F to read from different config file
080900: adjusted main() to new format of parseopt().
080900: adjusted main() to new format of readconfig().
210800: modified dogroup() - hopefully now every single article is by
	default tagged for deletion and will only be rescued if certain
	conditions are fulfilled.
210800: texpire crashed with a segmentation fault if no active file could
	be read. Bug described by Shaul Karl <shaulk@israsrv.net.il>; patch
	by Mark Brown <broonie@tardis.ed.ac.uk>.
180800: texpire contains some bug when allocating the overview info. This
	is very obvious if you swap the pointer to overview to the end of
	the exp{ } struct - texpire will then collapse with a segfault. I
	have not located the problem yet, however.
180800: added some comments when trying to understand the new threading
	code by Joerg Dietrich.
140700: included call to checkinteresting().
010700: expiregroup(): checks now also if the pointer g exists. Bug reported
	by Peter Katzmann <peter.katzmann@knuut.de>.
120300: replaced some strange succession of rewinddir() ... closedir() with
	a closedir() call. Based on a suggestion of Stephen Marley
	<stephen@home.uklinux.net> for leafnode-1.9.x.
120300: fixed call of lockfile_exists() to accommodate new format. Patch
        by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
290100: speedup patch by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>
090100: code cleanup in savethread() by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>
090100: fix expiregroup(), by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>
090100: Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> added option -D.
080100: expiregroup(): rewritten for use of arrays instead of trees.
211299: dogroup(): article numbers are not reset when a group is empty
	because this results in new articles not being displayed in
	low-traffic groups.
011299: dogroup(): converted some %d to %lu when printing "artno". Reported
	by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
011299: lookup_expire() now defined as "static time_t".
251199: texpire now indeed expires articles by thread. Patch by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net> which introduces two new functions,
	xoverextract() and savethread(), and patches dogroup(). This
	patch is supposed to also fix the memory allocation problem when
	article numbers are *very* different.
280899: dogroup(): when determining the first and last articles in the
	group, we now stat() every article and check whether it is a
	regular file. This saves troubles with groups like alt.2600
	where a directory alt/2600 exists and the 2600 was mistaken as
	an article number. Bug first reported by Holger Repp
	<retaliator@sbsd.de> and explained by Jeff Grossman
	<jeff@stikman.com>.

121000: replaced all (hopefully) occurrences of the old leafnode URL with
	http://www.leafnode.org/.
270900: leafnode.h: struct serverlist has new flag "active" which is
	set to TRUE for servers that should be indeed queried. This
	allows specification of several servers with "fetchnews -S".
190900: leafnode.h: removed "int alive" from struct newsgroup and
	inserted "unsigned long count" instead.
060900: makerpm.sh: patch by Karsten Merker <merker@linuxtag.org> to
	accommodate new names of tarballs created on 090800.
090800: Makefile.in: "make dist" now generates two tarballs, one with and
	one without PCRE code. Based on a suggestion of Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
180700: replaced all occurrences of exit(1) with exit(EXIT_FAILURE).
170700: Makefile.in: fetchnews is now installed mode 6755. Together with
	the changes in initvar() this should solve the FAQ of "how can I run
	fetchnews as user?". Suggested by Gunnar Ritter <g-r@bigfoot.de>.
170700: adjusted configure.in
050700: FAQ: added an explanation how to use sudo, originally written
	by Gerhard Schromm <Gerhard.Schromm@student.uni-ulm.de>.

050700: Makefile.in: added localutil.c
010700: makerpm.sh: now also works with SuSE. Patch by Juergen Salk
	<juergen.salk@gmx.net>.
310300: configure.in: now also test for snprintf() and vsnprintf(). So far
	this has no consequences - we don't yet have a replacement which
	is licensed under a free non-GPL license.
190300: Makefile.in: man pages now installed with "install" instead of "cp".
	Suggested by Mike Castle <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>.
120300: leafnode.h: additional functions added by Joerg Dietrich
	<joerg@dietrich.net>.

	Noted by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
100300: Makefile.in: "make clean" now also removes rnews. Patch by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
240200: FAQ now contains a paragraph why Leafnode is not licensed under
	the GPL.
130200: fixed small bug in configure.in which was introduced yesterday
130200: merged configure.in with the 1.9.11 version
120200: configure.in now checks for system includes. Suggested by Matthias

310100: added "char status" to newsgroups definition in leafnode.h
310100: "supplement" removed from documentation.

160100: changes in config.example and leafnode.8 suggested by Mark Brown
	<broonie@tardis.ed.ac.uk>.

	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
080100: leafnode.h: removed unnecessary elements "left" and "right" from
	struct newsgroup.
070100: Makefile.in: "make install" now sets /etc/leafnode/config* to mode
	600 and user:group "news".
060100: fetchnews.8: rewritten to make room for new options (some of which
	are currently still unimplemented)
060100: Makefile.in: re-added -lpcre to the rule for making applyfilter
030100: Makefile.in: /var/spool/news/failed.postings was not installed
	during "make install"
030100: added checks for setuid(), setgid() and mkstemp() to configure.in.
	Patch by Bruno Rohee <rohee@OpenBSD.ORG>.
211299: added "fetchnews -n" to the troubleshooting section of the README.

	added some changes to Makefile.in. I have tried to transplant these
	changes to the 2.0 version as well.
011299: removed lookup_expire() from leafnode.h
301199: configure.in: removed size determination of off_t entirely.
301199: configure.in: discovered a bug in autoconf-2.13 which prevents
	correct determination of sizeof(off_t). Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>
	showed me a way how to circumvent it.
291199: configure.in: check sizeof(off_t)
251199: configure.in: now detect BSD4.2-style syslog. Appropriate changes

	(i is now unsigned long instead of int), written by Joerg
	Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>.
181199: lsort now properly sorts the stuff (sorted only small files
	previously). Problem was that qsort uses pointers to the
	array members instead of the members itself.
171199: new program lsort, written by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>
	to circumvent problems with buggy sort versions from old GNU
	textutils (1.11).

	miscutil.c
181099: removed "#include <sys/types.h>" and "#include <regex.h>" from
	leafnode.h (not needed since we use PCRE)
091099: some miscellaneous patches by Joerg Dietrich <joerg@dietrich.net>
	to make leafnode glibc2-compatible.
081099: leafnode.h: BODY_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT deleted (not needed anymore)

210799: leafnode.h: switched "first" and "last" in newsgroup declaration
	from int to unsigned long.
210799: INSTALL: explanation how to upgrade an installed SuSE RPM with newer
	leafnode sources provided by Matthias Andree
	<ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>.
