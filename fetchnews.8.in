.SH NAME
fetchnews \- fetch news via NNTP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fetchnews -V
.br
.B fetchnews [-D debugmode] [-v] [-F configfile] -M message-id
.br
.B fetchnews [-BDfHnPv] [-F configfile] [-x number] [-S server[:port]] [-N newsgroup] [-t #]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
The design of
.B leafnode
is intended to self-repair after problems, and to require no
manual maintenance.
.PP
.B Fetchnews
(formerly called "fetch") is the program which submits and retrieves new
articles to or from the upstream NNTP server.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -B
Get only article bodies. Works only if "delaybody" option is set in the
configuration file (see below.)
.TP
.I -D debugmode
Switch on debug mode. This will log a lot of information via syslog to
the facility "news" with the priority "debug". Useful for tracking down
problems with your upstream server(s). See
.I config.example
for details on how to configure the debugmode.
.TP
.I -F configfile
Read configuration from an alternate config file instead of
@sysconfdir@/leafnode/config.
.TP
.I -f
Force rereading of whole active file from all upstream servers. This is
usually occurring only very infrequently because it takes a long time.
.TP
.I -H
Get only article headers. Works only if "delaybody" option is set in the
configuration file (see below).
.TP
.I -M message-id
Get only article with this message-id.
.TP
.I -n
Don't unlink files in the
.I interesting.groups
directory. This avoids automatic unsubscription of newsgroups.
.TP
.I -N newsgroup
Get only articles posted to "newsgroup".
.TP
.I -P
Only post articles that have accumulated in the
.I out.going
directory but do not fetch articles from upstream servers.
.TP
.I -S server[:port]
Only get articles on "server". You can specify this option multiple times
with different servers if you want to query several servers at once.
.br
If a server is running its NNTP service not on the standard port, you
can specify an alternative port by adding a colon and the port number
immediately behind the server name, without any whitespace inbetween.
.TP
.I -t number
Wait this many seconds before fetching next article. Useful if you need
bandwidth for something else but makes fetching slow.
.TP
.I -v
Be verbose.  A maximum of four
.I -v
can be used (the more v, the more verbose):
.TP
.I -v
Warn about non-critical errors.
.TP
.I -vv
Be verbose whenever a group command occurs.
.TP
.I -vvv
Be verbose whenever an article command occurs.
.TP
.I -vvvv
For debugging purposes. Don't expect the additional output to make sense.
.TP
.I -V
Print version number and exit.
.TP
.I "-x number"
Go
.I number
articles back and try to re-fetch what's missing. Useful to fill the
gaps after filter rules that used to be too aggressive have been relaxed.

.SH "FILES AND CONFIGURATION"
.BR leafnode (8)
for the list of files affected, and for information on configuring
.B fetchnews.
If you want to use filtering, see also
.BR filterfile (5)
for the format of the filterfile and
.BR pcre (7)
on the format of perl-compatible regular expressions.

.SH ALGORITHM
Here is a brief description of what
.B fetchnews
does.
.PP
First, after connecting to the upstream NNTP server,
all articles in
.I @SPOOLDIR@/out.going
are posted using POST.  If a posting fails, that article is moved to
.I @SPOOLDIR@/failed.postings
which an administrator has to clean up once in a while.  Moving a file
back to
.I @SPOOLDIR@/out.going 
is sufficient to resubmit it.
.PP
Second, the upstream server's list of newsgroups (obtained using LIST
ACTIVE and LIST NEWSGROUPS) is merged into
.BR leafnode "'s"
(this step is most often optimized away by using NEWGROUPS).
.PP
Third,
.B fetchnews
iterates over the list of newsgroups, performing a GROUP, an XOVER
and a number of ARTICLE commands for each group which has been read recently.

.SH NOTES
.B Fetchnews
does not use NEWNEWS because it is often very expensive on the remote
server.
.PP
The only way to control what newsgroups are accessible to local users
is to control what the upstream server lets
.B fetchnews
read, and that will not keep out all crossposts (endemic in e.g. the
alt.sex groups).  If your site is big enough that you need to control
newsgroup access, consider using a news server which is designed for a
big site.
.PP
.B Fetchnews
sets its real and effective uid to "news", because almost all of the
problems I have had with
.B leafnode
are due to files which aren't writable for user news.

.SH BUGS
.B Fetchnews
ignores "Also-Cancel" headers.
.PP
Fetchnews cannot delete groups from the list of active newsgroups
without getting full active files from all upstream servers.
Strictly spoken, this is not a fetchnews bug but a weakness of the
underlying NNTP protocol.
