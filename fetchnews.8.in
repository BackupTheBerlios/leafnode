.SH NAME
fetchnews \- fetch news via NNTP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fetchnews -V
.br
.B fetchnews [-BDfHnPv] [-D debugmode] [-v] [-F configfile]
.B [-M message-id] [...] [-x number] [-S server[:port]]
.B [-N newsgroup] [...] [-t #]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
The design of
.B leafnode
is intended to self-repair after problems, and to require no
manual maintenance.
.PP
.BR Fetchnews (8)
is the program which submits and retrieves new
articles to or from the upstream NNTP server.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -B
Get article bodies from groups that are in "delaybody" mode. Done by
default unless one of -H -M -R -P is used. See the configuration
section of leafnode(8) for "delaybody".
.TP
.I -D debugmode
Switch on debug mode. This will log a lot of information via syslog to
the facility "news" with the priority "debug". Useful for tracking down
problems with your upstream server(s). See
.I config.example
for details on how to configure the debugmode.
.TP
.I -F configfile
Read configuration from an alternate config file instead of
@sysconfdir@/config.
.TP
.I -f
Force rereading of whole active file from all upstream servers. This is
usually occurring only very infrequently because it takes a long time.
.TP
.I -H
Get article headers for groups that are in "delaybody" mode. Done by
default unless one of -B -M -R -P is used. See the configuration
section of leafnode(8) for "delaybody".
.TP
.I -M message-id
Get article with this message-id. NOTE: The message-id MUST be
surrounded by angle brackets. Use single quotes to protect the
message-ID angle brackets, dollar signs and other meta characters from
shell interpretation. The -M option can be used multiple times to get
more than one article.
.B Example:

fetchnews -M '<1234$5678@example.org>'
.TP
.I -n
Don't unlink files in the
.I interesting.groups
directory. This avoids automatic unsubscription of newsgroups, see
.B EXPIRY OF NEWSGROUPS
below.
.TP
.I -N newsgroup
Get only articles posted to "newsgroup". The -N option can be used
multiple times to get articles from more than one group.
.TP
.I -P
Post articles that have accumulated in the
.I out.going
directory. Done by default unless one of -B -H -M -R is used.
.TP
.I -R
Get articles from groups that are not in "delaybody" mode. Done by
default unless one of -B -H -M -P is used. See the configuration
section of leafnode(8) for "delaybody".
.TP
.I -S server[:port]
Only get articles on "server". You can specify this option multiple times
with different servers if you want to query several servers at once.
.br
If a server is running its NNTP service not on the standard port, you
can specify an alternative port by adding a colon and the port number
immediately behind the server name, without any whitespace inbetween.
.TP
.I -t number
Wait this many seconds before fetching next article. This is useful if
you need bandwidth for something else, but it makes fetching slow.
.TP
.I -v
Be verbose.  A maximum of four
.I -v
can be used (the more v, the more verbose):
.TP
.I -v
Warn about non-critical errors.
.TP
.I -vv
Be verbose whenever a server command occurs.
.TP
.I -vvv
Be verbose whenever a group command occurs.
.TP
.I -vvvv
Be verbose whenever an article command occurs.
.TP
.I -vvvvv
For debugging purposes. Don't expect the additional output to make sense.
.TP
.I -V
Print version number and exit.
.TP
.I "-x number"
Go
.I number
articles back and try to re-fetch what's missing. Useful to fill the
gaps after filter rules that used to be too aggressive have been relaxed.

.SH ALGORITHM
Here is a brief description of what
.B fetchnews
does.
.PP
First, it checks which newsgroups are no longer requested by clients,
according to the procedure shown below in the section
.B "EXPIRY OF NEWSGROUPS."
.PP
Then it will connect to the upstream NNTP servers one after another,
and, unless changed by options, perform these steps:
.PP
First after connecting to the upstream NNTP server,
all articles in
.I @SPOOLDIR@/out.going
are posted using POST.  If a posting fails, that article is moved to
.I @SPOOLDIR@/failed.postings
which an administrator has to clean up once in a while.  Moving a file
back to
.I @SPOOLDIR@/out.going
is sufficient to retry the submission.
.PP
Second, the upstream server's list of newsgroups (obtained using LIST
ACTIVE and LIST NEWSGROUPS) is merged into
.BR leafnode "'s"
(this step is most often optimized away by using NEWGROUPS).
.PP
Third,
.B fetchnews
iterates over the list of newsgroups, performing a GROUP, an XOVER
and a number of ARTICLE commands for each group which has been read recently.

.SH "EXPIRY OF NEWSGROUPS"
.BR Fetchnews (8)
will drop newsgroup subscriptions after a certain amount of time a
particular "interesting" group has not been read, unless run with the
.I -n
option.
.PP
.BR Leafnode(8)
will track for each group (a) when the last posting has been downloaded
from the upstream
.I (.last.posting),
(b) when an article in the group or
the group overview data has been requested by a client.  Newsgroups are
removed from the interesting.groups directory and hence no longer
fetched when the newsgroup has not been accessed by any reader for
.I timeout_long
days after the freshest posting has arrived, or
.I timeout_short
days when the group has never been accessed since the placeholder
article has been read.
.PP
This avoids the unsubscription of low-traffic newsgroups, for instance,
announcements groups. As a consequence, newsgroups will only be removed
from interesting.groups when
.BR fetchnews (8)
has downloaded postings AFTER you have unsubscribed the groups in your
newsreader.
.PP
Technically, the arrival time of the freshest postings former is marked
in the ctime of the
.I .last.posting
file in the group directory by
.BR fetchnews (8),
and the time of the last access by newsreaders is marked in the ctime of
the
.I group.name
file below
.I @SPOOLDIR@/interesting.groups
by
.BR leafnode (8).
.PP
For a newly subscribed group that has not been read more than once, the
.I interesting.group/group.name's
ctime will match its mtime. In this case,
.I timeout_short
applies instead of
.I timeout_long.
.PP
You can use "ls -lc" or "ls -ltc" or the
.BR lsmac.pl (1)
utility to view the ctime(s) of a particular directory or file or set of
files.
.PP
Dormant groups do not expire.
.PP
Note that this time mechanism does not recover when your system clock is
changed, so make sure your system clock is right. A few minutes off
don't matter practically; daylight savings time is invisible to
leafnode and hence does not matter either.
.PP
It is a good idea to run some NTP software, for instance, "ntpd" or
"chrony", against your ISP's NTP server, when you've got a permanent
internet connection, or to run "ntpd -g -q -x" or "ntpdate" right after
your dialup connection goes online. Chrony and Ntpd are third-party
packages that do not ship with leafnode and the documentation of which
are beyond the scope of this manual.

.SH "FILES AND CONFIGURATION"
.BR leafnode (8)
for the list of files affected, and for information on configuring
.B fetchnews.
If you want to use filtering, see also
.BR filterfile (5)
for the format of the filterfile and
.BR pcre (3)
on the format of perl-compatible regular expressions.

.SH NOTES
.B Fetchnews
does not use NEWNEWS because it is often very expensive on the remote
server.
.PP
The only way to control what newsgroups are accessible to local users
is to control what the upstream server lets
.B fetchnews
read, and that will not keep out all crossposts (endemic in e.g. the
alt.sex groups).  If your site is big enough that you need to control
newsgroup access, consider using a news server which is designed for a
big site.
.PP
.B Fetchnews
sets its real and effective uid to "news", because almost all of the
problems I have had with
.B leafnode
are due to files which aren't writable for user news.

.SH BUGS
.B Fetchnews
ignores "Also-Cancel" headers.
.PP
Fetchnews cannot delete groups from the list of active newsgroups
without getting full active files from all upstream servers.
Strictly spoken, this is not a fetchnews bug but a weakness of the
underlying NNTP protocol.
