.SH NAME
filterfile \- filter configuration file for fetchnews(8)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
.B Fetchnews
(formerly called "fetch") is the program which submits and retrieves new
articles to or from the upstream NNTP server. It has a filtering facility
which makes it possible to select for or against certain articles, based
on what is stored in the article headers. The headers are matched against
patterns stored in a file which
.B Fetchnews
determines from the
.I filterfile
entry in the main leafnode configuration file.

.PP
The
.I filterfile
stores a number of entries in the following format.
.RS

newsgroups = [!]\fIPCRE\fR
.br
pattern = [!]\fIPCRE\fR
.br
action = {kill|select|\fIscore\fR}

.RE
Based on these entries,
.BR fetchnews
decides whether to retrieve an article from the upstream server or not.
The entries are considered from the top down.

.PP
The
.BR [!]\fInewsgroups\fR
parameter determines which newsgroup(s) the following patterns should be
applied to. You can use
.B PCRE
expressions as explained in the 
.B pcre
manual page. When prefixed with an exclamation point, the match result
is inverted, i. e. the rule applies if the newsgroup name is \fBnot\fR
matched by the PCRE, useful for "for all newsgroups except... do"-style
filters. The newsgroup rule is memorized and can be used for more than
one pattern/action pair. It is valid until the next newsgroups parameter
turns up.

.PP
The
.BR pattern
.BR to
.BR recognize
can be one of the following:
.TP
pattern = [!]\fIpcre\fR
Filter on any pattern that may occur in a header. Leafnode uses
Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) which are explained in
a separate manual page (
.BR pcre (7)
or, on newer systems,
.BR pcre (3)).
You can prefix the pattern with an exclamation point to invert its
meaning, but this is usually not what you want. You USUALLY mean to use
an inverted assertion, such as

pattern = ^Subject:(?!.*bad weather)

Be very careful when using the | operator. Make sure you use parentheses
to tell PCRE which part you want matched. "^Subject: Jens|Jan" is
different from "^Subject: (Jens|Jan)" -- the former matches either
"^Subject: Jens" or "Jan", and because these are applied to any header,
the former PCRE would match on all articles posted in January.
.TP
maxage = [days]
Filter on age of articles in days. Articles that are older are
selected for the consecutive action.
.TP
minlines = [n]
Filter on the length of articles in lines. Articles that have less
than n lines are selected for the consecutive action.
.TP
maxlines = [n]
Filter on the length of articles in lines. Articles that have more
than n lines are selected for the consecutive action.
.TP
maxbytes = [n]
Filter on the length of articles in bytes. Articles that have more
than n bytes are selected for the consecutive action.
.TP
maxcrosspost = [n]
Filter on the number of groups the article is posted to. Articles
that are posted to more than n groups are selected for the
consecutive action.

.PP
The
.BR action
parameter finally determines what fetchnews should do when encountering
a pattern. Since each action is dependent on a pattern, both of them must
be defined. There are three actions to choose from:

.RS
.PP
.I kill
.br
The article in question is not fetched if the pattern has been matched.
No further patterns are considered.

.PP
.I select
.br
The article in question is fetched if the pattern has been matched. No
further patterns are considered.

.PP
[
.I score
]
.br
.I score
is a positive or negative integer value. The value is added to the score
of the article if the pattern has been matched. Further patterns are
considered. If, after consideration of all patterns, the score is below
zero, the article is not fetched; otherwise it is fetched.

.RE

.SH EFFICIENCY
.PP
For efficient filtering, you should prefer upstream newsservers that
support the "XOVER" command, and only use filter criteria that can be
satisfied from overview data. This means only filter on these headers
with "pattern": Subject, From, Date, Message-ID, References, Bytes, Lines.

Filtering maxage, minlines, maxlines, maxbytes is fine. maxcrosspost
filtering currently is expensive, and will only apply after the whole
article has been downloaded.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
The first example shows how to avoid "fast money"-type postings in all
newsgroups:

.RS
newsgroups = *
.br
pattern = ^Subject:.*fast.?money
.br
action = kill
.RE

This pattern is applied to all newsgroups. Only the Subject:-line is matched
(if the "^" was omitted, other headers containing "Subject:.*fast.?money"
would be matched as well). The amount of characters between the header
name and the "fast" may be arbitrary ("." means "any char" and the "*"
designates that an arbitrary number, including zero, of these characters
may be there) while between "fast" and "money" there must be at least one
other character (designated by the "?"). For further explanations of
Perl-compatible regular expressions, see
.BR pcre (7).

.PP
The second example shows how to avoid articles in a specific newsgroup
unless they deal with a certain subject:

.RS
newsgroups = alt.hippopotamus
.br
pattern = ^Subject:.*[Hh]ippo
.br
action = select
.br
pattern = ^Subject:.*
.br
action = kill
.RE

Working from the top down, fetchnews will immediately select all articles
in alt.hippopotamus that contain "Hippo" or "hippo" in the subject. If
this expression is not matched, all articles will match the second
expression and therefore be not fetched.

.PP
Finally, the third example shows another way to select certain articles,
using scoring.

.RS
newsgroups = alt.hippopotamus.*
.br
pattern = ^Subject:.*[Hh]ippo
.br
action = 5
.br
pattern = ^Subject:.*telekinesis
.br
action = -3
.RE

We are interested in hippopotamus but not in telekinesis. This filter will
kill all postings to the alt.hippopotamus hierarchy which deal with the
latter, except if they report telekinesis in connection with hippos. (Of
course, there may be other ways to achieve the same result.)

.PP
While in these examples filtering was always done on the Subject: line,
there is no reason not to apply filters to arbitrary headers, e.g.
certain posters, MIME-encoded postings or whatever you can imagine.

.SH WILDMATS
The
.I wildmat
format was first developed by Rich Salz based on the format used in the
UNIX "find" command to articulate file names. It was developed to provide
a uniform mechanism for matching patterns in the same manner that the
UNIX shell matches filenames. Patterns are implicitely anchored at the
beginning and end of each string when testing for a match. There are
five pattern matching operations other than a strict one-to-one match
between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match. The first
is an asterisk (*) to match any sequence of zero or more characters. The
second is a question mark (?) to match any single character. The third
specifies a specific set of characters. The set is specified as a list
of characters, or as a range of characters where the beginning and end
of the range are separated by a minus (or dash) character, or as any
combination of lists and ranges. The dash can also be included in the
set as a character if it is the beginning or end of the set. This set is
enclosed in square brackets. The close square bracket (]) may be used in
a set if it is the first character in the set. The fourth operation is
the same as the logical not of the third operation and is specified the
same way as the third with the addition of a caret character (^) at the
beginning of the test string just inside the open square bracket. The
final operation uses the backslash character to invalidate the special
meaning of the open square bracket ([), the asterisk, backslash or the
question mark. Two backslashes in sequence will result in the evaluation
of the backslash as a character with no special meaning.

.PP
.BR Leafnode
modifies the wildmat format somewhat: patterns that do not specify
a range of characters are matched in a case-insensitive manner. This
is necessary since newsgroups names are de facto not matched in a
case-sensitive manner. If you want to enforce case-sensitive pattern
matching, include a range somewhere in your pattern.

.SH BUGS
Neither the newsgroups name nor the pattern may contain a hash mark (#).
