NOTE: the local.groups and groupinfo files have changed from any former
version to 2.0b8_ma8pre. Also, the hash function has changed from any
former releases Cornelius did.

1. FIX local.groups:

To fix local.groups, if you have perl installed:
  perl -ple 's /\s+/\ty\t/' -i.bak /etc/leafnode/local.groups
This will make a backup of your original /etc/leafnode/local.groups.

If you don't have Perl, use a text editor that preserves HTAB
characters, change all while space to TAB and insert an additional field
reading just y:

Before: local.test some test group
After:  local.testTAByTABsome test group

Use the real TAB character rather than TAB.

2. To fix the "remote" groups, run fetchnews -f

3. To fix the spool to be able to access old articles by Message-IDs,
   run texpire -r
