To get useful debugging out of leafnode-2, do this:

1. log in as root

2. in your /etc/leafnode/config, add a line "debugmode=129" to the top of
   the file, to debug NNTP. Add other values given in that file to your
   debugmode if you need other debug logs than NNTP command/reply traces.
   For example, if you want filtering debugged, use "debugmode=33", and if
   you want filtering, locking, configuration parsing and NNTP chatter
   debugged, use 1 + 32 + 64 + 16 + 128 = 241.

3. in your /etc/syslog.conf, add this line:

   news.debug   /var/log/news.all

   There is a tab character between the columns here.

4. touch /var/log/news.all

5. kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid'

Two more hints:

a. On some syslogds (Linux), you can add a - before the file name of step
   #2 to have syslog write asynchronously for speed, like this:

   news.*      -/var/log/news.all

   Again, there is a tab character between the columns here.

b. Some syslogds may complain about the asterisk in news.*. If yours does,
   write news.debug instead of news.*.
