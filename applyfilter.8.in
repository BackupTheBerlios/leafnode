.SH SYNOPSIS
.B applyfilter -V

is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
.B Applyfilter
is the program to apply filter settings to your newsspool. It is used
if you want to remove postings from your spool matching a certain filter
pattern (see FILES below). If the headers of an article match any of
the filtering rules, the article is deleted from the newsgroup.

sets its real and effective uid to "news".

Read configuration from an alternate config file instead of
