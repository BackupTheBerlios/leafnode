.SH NAME
applyfilter \- apply filter settings to news spool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B applyfilter -V
.br
.B applyfilter [-Dv] [-F configfile] [newsgroup]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
.B Applyfilter
is the program to apply filter settings to your newsspool. It is used
if you want to remove postings from your spool matching a certain filter
pattern (see FILES below). If the headers of an article match any of
the filtering rules, the article is being deleted from the newsgroup.
.PP
.B Applyfilter
sets its real and effective uid to "news".

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -D
Switch on debug mode. This will log a lot of information via syslog to
the facility "news" with the priority "debug". Useful for tracking down
problems. If debug mode has already been set in the config file, increase
verbosity.
.TP
.I -F configfile
Read configuration from an alternate config file instead of
@LIBDIR@/config.
.TP
.I -v
Be verbose.
.TP
.I -V
Print version number and exit.
.TP
.I newsgroup
is the newsgroup you want to apply the filter to.

.SH FILES
.PP
.I @LIBDIR@/filters
contains the set of filtering rules that are applied to the newsspool.
Each rule must be on a separate line. Empty lines and comments (marked
by a # at the beginning of the line) are allowed.
.PP
Each rule is a regular expression. For example, the following set of
rulings will delete all crosspostings to alt.flame.
.PP
^Newsgroups:.*[,]alt.flame$
.br
^Newsgroups:.*[,]alt.flame,
.PP
^Newsgroups: indicates that the pattern should only be applied to the
Newsgroups: header. After the header, an arbitrary number of characters
may follow, ending in either a comma or a space. After that, alt.flame
must be in the line, either at the end of the line (first entry) or in
the middle of the line, followed by other newsgroups (second entry).
