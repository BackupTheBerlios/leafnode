<h3 align=center>1. OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>Leafnode is a USENET software package designed for small sites, with a
few tens of readers and only a slow link to the net. It is developed
on Linux, but has been reported to compile and run also under any BSD
flavour, Solaris and Irix.

<p>The Leafnode package consists of several programs, three essential ones
and several add-ons.

<UL>
<LI><u>Leafnode</u> is the NNTP server.  It talks to the normal news clients,
    and stores readership data.
<LI><u>Fetchnews</u> is the NNTP news-gatherer.  It looks at the readership
    data Leafnode stores, and selects what groups to pull news from. It
    also transfers your contributions to one or more upstream servers.
<LI><u>Texpire</u> is responsible for deleting old and uninteresting news.  It
    deletes all discussion threads that are old and not recently read.
</UL>

<p>
These are the additional tools:

<UL>
<LI><u>Applyfilter</u> lets you delete articles from your local news spool
    which fit a certain pattern.
<LI><u>Checkgroups</u> inserts the titles of newsgroups into the newsgroup
    database.
<LI><u>Newsq</u> shows which news are waiting to be transferred to your
    upstream server(s).
<LI><u>Rnews</u> sorts an UUCP batch or articles downloaded by other means 
    into the news spool.
</UL>

<p>Only groups that someone has been reading in the past week are fetched
from the upstream NNTP server.  When someone stops reading a group,
fetchnews will stop reading that group a week later (this is the default
which can be configured), and when someone starts reading a group, fetchnews
will grab all the articles it can in that group the next time it runs.

<p>Leafnode's distinguishing features are:

<UL>
<LI>Leafnode is written with the novice user in mind. It is very
    easy to install and configure and requires no manual intervention
    once installed. Leafnode tries very hard to recover automatically
    from error situations.
<LI>Compared to other servers, leafnode uses very little disk space
    and bandwidth. Of course this also depends on how many users
    are accessing your server and is probably not true for 300-user
    sites.
<LI>The newsspool can be easily manipulated by small scripts because
    it is maintained in plain file format. Some tiny examples are
    in the subdirectory tools/ .
</UL>

<p>
Of course, Leafnode also has weaknesses. Some of these are:

<UL>
<LI>In just any error situation, leafnode tries to fix its problems by
    deleting the offending article. This can cause leafnode to lose news.
<LI>Due to its open architecture, Leafnode scales very badly.
</UL>

<p>The current version of leafnode is available from http://www.leafnode.org/ .

<p>There is also a leafnode mailing list. Send mail to
<p align=center>
	leafnode-list@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de
<p>with "Subscribe" in the Subject: to subscribe.

<h3 align=center>2. INSTALLATION</h3>

<OL>
<LI>Leafnode depends on the PCRE regular-expression matching library. It ships
as binary package with many current Linux/BSD distributions, and is also
available as port for *BSD. Just install the binary package for your operating
system if it ships with one. If it comes without PCRE, don't worry, the
installation from source is simple. To install PCRE, do (AS NORMAL USER, NOT AS root!)
<OL>
<LI>Download the current PCRE version from <a
href="http://www.pcre.org/">http://www.pcre.org/</a>.
<LI>Unpack PCRE: gunzip -c | tar xvf -
<LI>cd pcre-3.9 <BR><I>(This is for PCRE-3.9, for other versions, replace that by the path that tar wrote when unpacking.)</I>
<LI>type <KBD>./configure && make</KBD> <br><i>there should be no errors</i>
<LI>become root
<LI>as root, do <KBD>make install</KBD>
<LI>as root, do <KBD>ldconfig</KBD> <br><i>this may not be needed on all
systems, but better safe than sorry</i>
<LI>exit your root shell
<LI>DONE!
</OL>
<LI>Leafnode uses GNU autoconf to determine the configuration of the
machine it will be compiled on. It also uses GNU automake for all the standard
features that GNU automake offers. Type (AS NORMAL USER, NOT AS root!)
<pre>
         /bin/sh ./configure
</pre>
to create an appropriate Makefile and config.h. If leafnode cannot find your
PCRE, it is probably an old version without pcre-config, or pcre-config is not
in your path. Either add the directory containing pcre-config to your $PATH, or
call configure like this (we assume PCRE is in /opt/pcre-3.9):

<pre>
         env CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/pcre-3.9" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/pcre-3.9" /bin/sh ./configure
</pre>

NOTE: on some machines, when PCRE is linked against a shared library, you will need
to add /opt/pcre-3.9 to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or to /etc/ld.so.conf.

<P>The configure script can take some flags (replace DIR by a directory name,
FILE by a file name):
<pre>
--spooldir=DIR		  To override the default /var/spool/news,
			  where leafnode puts its news spool.

--lockfile=FILE		  To override the default /var/run/news/fetchnews.lock,
			  where leafnode puts its lock file.

--prefix=DIR		  Leafnode installs itself normally in the /usr/local/sbin
			  directory. If you want to use another directory, use this
			  flag. For example, if you want to install leafnode in
			  /usr/sbin, use --prefix=/usr

--sysconfdir=DIR          Default path for configuration is /etc when
			  --prefix is not used or set to /usr, and PREFIX/etc
			  otherwise.  You can use this to change the config file
			  location from its default.
			  IMPORTANT NOTE: leafnode will automatically
			  append "leafnode" to the sysconfdir, so if you
			  want your configuration in
			  /etc/news/leafnode/, use --sysconfdir=/etc/news

--with-dmalloc            Lets leafnode include dmalloc header files and link
			  against libdmalloc. Only useful for debugging, not
			  needed for normal operation. This option requires
			  dmalloc, available from http://dmalloc.com/.

--with-runas-user=USER    Lets leafnode run as user USER, defaults to "news".
</pre>

<strong>BEWARE:</strong> Former versions always defaulted their sysconfdir to
/etc/leafnode. Current versions only override sysconfdir to /etc/leafnode if
configured without --prefix or with --prefix=/usr. That way, if
--prefix=/opt/leafnode, the sysconfdir goes to /opt/leafnode/etc, which
is more appropriate.

<LI>Type
<pre>
          make
</pre>
There should be no errors.

<LI>Become root.

<LI>As root, create user and group "news" (or the configured user and group)
if you don't have those already. 

<LI>Type
<pre>
          make install
</pre>
If you prefer an installation with the binaries stripped free of symbols,
use
<pre>
	  make install-strip
</pre>
instead.

<br><I>For packagers: if you want to prefix all installation paths with a common
prefix, e. g. to support RPM's BuildRoot feature: You can use
<KBD>make install-strip DESTDIR=/var/tmp/leafnode-root</KBD>.</I>

<LI>If you are updating leafnode from a previous version, see the section
"Updating" below.

<LI>Edit $(LIBDIR)/config. $(LIBDIR) defaults to /etc/leafnode, but can be
adjusted at build time. For documentation, see below or config.example
and leafnode(8). <strong>Mandatory edits to the config file are:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>server -- this must point to your upstream news server.
<LI>expire -- how many days will downloaded articles remain in the spool.
</UL>

Make sure the environment variable $NNTPSERVER
or /etc/nntpserver points to your own host so clients will talk to
leafnode rather than try to go to the upstream server.

<p>If you want to use filtering of the incoming spool, see the section on
the filter file below.

<LI>Set up a cron job (as user "root" or "news") to run texpire every night
or maybe every week. Here is my crontab line, which runs nightly:
<pre>
0 4 * * * /usr/local/sbin/texpire
</pre>
I did "crontab -u news -e" as root to edit the crontab file, and added
this line.  Substituting "1" for the third "*", thus:
<pre>
0 4 * * 1 /usr/local/sbin/texpire
</pre>
tells cron to run texpire at 4am every Monday morning.

<LI>Make sure fetchnews is run at the appropriate time. If you have a
full-time link, run it out of cron (as "news" again); if not, run it
when your connection to the net is established. If it is run as root
it will change to user "news". If you use PPP, you can run fetchnews
from /etc/ppp/ip-up (or /etc/ppp/ip-up.local, depending on your OS).

<LI>We assume that you have tcpd installed, it ships with most
distributions. If you don't have it, fetch it from
ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/, it's in tcp_wrappers, and install
it. It's preferable if you compile it with -DHOSTS_OPTIONS, and the
examples below assume you did.

<LI>Choose either of these alternatives:
<UL>
<LI>Alternative #1: If your system uses inetd (most commercial unices,
*BSD). Edit /etc/inetd.conf so that $(BINDIR)/leafnode is executed for incoming
NNTP connections.  Here is my inetd.conf line:
<pre>
nntp    stream  tcp     nowait  news    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/leafnode
</pre>

<I>Note: some systems install tcpd to a different path, but it's
uncommon. Change the first path accordingly if your tcpd resides in
/usr/etc or /usr/lbin.</i>

After these changes, force inetd to read the changed configuration file
by sending it the HANGUP signal. To achieve this, issue the following
command (as root):
<pre>
kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
</pre>

<LI>Alternative #2: If your system has xinetd instead. Add this to your
xinetd.conf (this example assumes xinetd 2.3.3 or newer):

<pre>
service nntp
{
        flags           = NAMEINARGS NOLIBWRAP
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        wait            = no
        user            = news
        server          = /usr/sbin/tcpd
        server_args     = /usr/local/sbin/leafnode
        instances       = 7
        per_source      = 3
}
</pre>

Then send xinetd an USR2 signal to make it reread its configuration. See
the <B>xinetd.conf</B>(5) manual page for details.

<I>Note: some systems install tcpd to a different path, but it's
uncommon. Change the first path accordingly if your tcpd resides in
/usr/etc or /usr/lbin.</i>

</UL>
<LI>Write the following into /etc/hosts.deny:
<pre>
leafnode: ALL
</pre>
and into /etc/hosts.allow:
<pre>
leafnode: 127.0.0.1
</pre>
to protect your news server from abuse. If you want to make leafnode
accessible to additional IP numbers/domains, add them in /etc/hosts.allow
in the format described above. See hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5)
(if applicable) for more information about tcp wrappers.

<LI><I>(optional)</I>
If you want to allow read-only access, you can set the NOPOSTING
environment variable, for example, put this into /etc/hosts.allow:

<pre>
leafnode: 192.168.0.4: setenv NOPOSTING "You may only read."
</pre>

The contents of this variable are printed at the end of the banner, with
control characters (as per iscntrl(3)) replaced by an underscore.

<LI>Run fetchnews. The first run will take some time since fetchnews reads
a list of all newsgroups from your upstream server. In the worst case,
this can take up to 60 minutes, depending on how many newsgroups your
provider offers and how reliable your modem connection is. To see
fetchnews working, run it with -vvv.

<LI>Run texpire. It will create directories missing after the first install.

<LI>Exit your root shell.

<LI>Read news using an NNTP client (with $NNTPSERVER or /etc/nntpserver
pointing to your own host). Select the groups you want to read in
the future. You will find them empty except a default article.
Reading this article is necessary with some newsreaders to select
the groups for further fetching.

<p>After this, you should have empty files in
/var/spool/news/interesting.groups/ for every group you want to read.

<LI>Become root and run fetchnews again, then exit your root shell.
This run should pick up all the groups you want to read.
</OL>

<h3 align=center>3. UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS</h3>

<h3 align=center>3.1 Update from versions &lt; 2.0b8_ma8</h3>

<p>The local.groups and groupinfo files and the hash function for message.id
have changed from any former version to 2.0b8_ma8.

<P><STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG>To fix the "remote" groups, run <KBD>fetchnews
-f</KBD> -- it will take some time, because if refetches the whole
active file, but that's needed anyhow to figure the group status
(posting allowed/not allowed/moderated group).

<p>To fix <strong>local.groups</strong>, if you have perl installed:

<PRE>
  perl -ple 's /\s+/\ty\t/' -i.bak /etc/leafnode/local.groups
</PRE>

This will make a backup of your original /etc/leafnode/local.groups in
/etc/leafnode/local.groups.bak.

<p>If you don't have Perl, use a text editor that preserves HTAB
characters, change all while space to TAB and insert an additional field
reading just y:

<blockquote>
Before: local.test some test group
<br>After:  local.testTAByTABsome test group
</blockquote>

<br>Use the real TAB character rather than TAB.

<br>To fix the spool for message.ids, run <kbd>texpire -r</kbd>

<br>The changes written in section 3.2 below also apply.

<h3 align=center>3.2 Update from versions &lt; 2.0</h3>

<p>From 1.9.x to 2.0 there were some changes to options in the main
configuration file. The options "maxage", "maxlines", "minlines",
"maxbytes" and "maxcrosspost" have become obsolete in the main
configuration file and have to be specified in the filter file
instead. The advantage of this is that you can do much finer
selection on these criteria now.

<p>To replace, for example, a "maxage = 5" specification in the
main configuration file, you should add the following to your
filter file:

<pre>
newsgroups = *
maxage = 5
action = kill
</pre>

<p>The leafnode programs will issue warnings if they encounter
obsolete specifications in the main config file.

<h3 align=center>3.3 Update from versions &lt; 1.9.3</h3>

<p>
From version 1.9.3 on, the groupinfo file is sorted in a case-insensitive
manner. To update correctly, do a "make update" as root after you have
successfully completed "make install". This will re-sort the groupinfo
file. The old groupinfo file will be stored as groupinfo.old just in
case something goes wrong. You also have to change your main config
file manually as described in the last section.

<h3 align=center>3.4 Update from versions &lt; 1.6</h3>

<p>
Between leafnode-1.6alpha and leafnode-1.6, the format of the groupinfo
file changed and some files moved to other places. To update correctly,
do a "make update" as root after you have successfully completed
"make install". This will reformat the groupinfo file and move the
other files into the correct places. The old groupinfo file will be
stored as groupinfo.old just in case something goes wrong. You also
have to change your main config file manually as described in the
section "Update from versions &lt; 2.0".

<hr>

<h3 align=center>4. FILES AND DIRECTORIES</h3>

<p>
Leafnode puts its files in three separate directories: The spool
directory, the library directory, and the binaries directory. All
directories can be changed at compile time.

<p>
In the spool directory you find the stored news, the active file and
some other short-lived configuration file. It defaults to /var/spool/news
and can be changed at compilation time. There are some special
directories here; see the leafnode(8) man page.

<p>
The library directory contains long-lived configuration files. It
defaults to /etc/leafnode.

<p>
The binaries directory, /usr/local/sbin by default, contains the
executable programs applyfilter, texpire, fetchnews and leafnode.

<p>
The user directory, /usr/local/bin by default, contains the newsq
program.

<h3 align=center>4.1. The main configuration file</h3>

<p>
The main configuration file contains settings important for all
programs of the leafnode suite. It defaults to /etc/leafnode/config,
but several configuration files can be used at once by employing
the -F switch of the programs.

<p>The file contains two mandatory and a number of optional parameters.

<p>NOTE: Global options must come first, server-specific options below the
server = lines.

<p><b>Mandatory parameters</b>

<p>
<blockquote>server = news02.bigprovider.com</blockquote>
You have to specify at least one server (except if you want leafnode
to serve as a local server only). Usually, this will be the news
server of your provider. You can specify more than one server, and
fetchnews will retrieve news from all of them, taking care not to
transfer articles multiple times to your machine. Servers will be
queried in the order specified in the config file.

<p>
<blockquote>expire = 5</blockquote>
This parameter determines how many days threads are kept on your
hard disk. texpire will delete whole threads, not just single
articles.

<p><b>Server-specific optional parameters</b>

<p>
To configure interaction with the server somewhat, you can change
the behaviour of fetchnews by setting several server-specific
optional parameters. They have to be specified directly after
the corresponding "server" statement. A new server statement in
the config file will also allow new optional parameters.

<p>
<blockquote>username = myname<br>
password = mypasswd</blockquote>
If your upstream server requires a form of authentication, you
can set your username and password here.

<p>
<blockquote>timeout = 30</blockquote>
It may happen that, due to a bad connection or other reasons,
the server stops talking to you while you fetch news. The
"timeout" parameter determines the number of seconds fetchnews
is supposed to wait for a response from the server before
giving up.

<p>
<blockquote>nodesc = 1</blockquote>
Some servers are unable to deliver descriptions of new newsgroups
correctly. When fetchnews encounters such a server, it will print
the warning
<blockquote>
server.name does not process LIST NEWSGROUPS news.group.name
correctly: use nodesc
</blockquote>
To allow for shorter download times, you should in this case set
"nodesc = 1" for that particular server in the configuration file.

<p>
<blockquote>port = 8000</blockquote>
Normally, fetchnews will try to retrieve news from port 119 (the
standard nntp port) of your upstream server. If the upstream server
runs on a different port, you can specify it with this option.

<p><b>General optional parameters</b>

<p>
<blockquote>authenticate = <i>METHOD</i></blockquote>
Require that NNTP clients connecting to your leafnode authenticate themselves.
The only method currently
supported is <tt>internal</tt>. In this mode, leafnode expects a file
<i>users</i> in its sysconfdir, /etc/leafnode/users by default, which has a
simple format, one line per user, with the user name (which cannot contain
spaces), then a colon, then the crypt(3) encrypted password. To
generate these lines, you can use the Perl program <i>tools/make_pass.pl</i>,
for example, if you want to add a user "enigma" with a password of "break!me",
type:
<blockquote>perl -wT tools/make_pass.pl 'enigma' 'break!me'</blockquote> 
and copy the
resulting line to the <i>users</i> file.<br>htpasswd as
shipped for Apache servers should also work if in crypt(3) mode.

<p>
<blockquote>hostname = host.domain.country</blockquote>
If the postings that you write do not have message IDs (generated
by the newsreader), leafnode will generate a message ID for you.
(It will never overwrite an already existing message ID.) Message
IDs generated by leafnode feature ".ln" before the @ sign. The
message ID contains the fully qualified hostname of your machine
which may not always be what you want. In that case, you can
override the use of the hostname by using the "hostname" option.

<p>
<blockquote>create_all_links = 1</blockquote>
Usually fetchnews will store articles only in the newsgroups which
you consider interesting. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult
to score for the number of newsgroups a message is posted to because
the Newsgroups: header is not featured in the overview information;
therefore you can determine the number of newsgroups an article
is crossposted to only from the Xref: header. If "create_all_links"
is set to 1, fetchnews will store articles in all newsgroups which
they are posted to, making all these newsgroups turn up in the
Xref: header.

<p>
<blockquote>groupexpire = a.news.group 7</blockquote>
As outlined above, texpire will expire threads after "expire" days.
If you want to adjust expiry times for certain groups, you may use
the "groupexpire" parameter to do just that. You can specify groups
or use wildcards; for example
<blockquote>groupexpire = *.announce 30</blockquote>
will affect expiry times of all groups ending with ".announce".

<p>
<blockquote>filterfile = /etc/leafnode/filters</blockquote>
If you want to employ filtering on incoming messages, you have to
specify the path where the filterfile can be found. The format of
the filterfile is described in the next chapter.

<p>
<blockquote>timeout_short = 2<br>
timeout_long = 5</blockquote>
These two parameters determine how quickly a group is unsubscribed
by leafnode after you have stopped reading it. If you have looked
into the group only once, subscription is stopped after "timeout_short"
days; if you have read it more regularly, subscription is stopped
after "timeout_long" days. (You can stop subscription immediately
by removing the corresponding file in /var/spool/news/interesting.groups/).

<p>
<blockquote>timeout_active = 90</blockquote>
By default, fetchnews will re-read active files from the upstream
server every 90 days. This interval can be changed by setting
"timeout_active" to a different value. Re-reading the active file
frequently will keep it a little bit smaller but will increase
the on-line time.

<p>
<blockquote>delaybody = 1</blockquote>
This option switches fetchnews into a mode where only the headers
of articles are fetched for visual inspection. Only the articles
read in the newsreader will be retrieved the next time fetchnews
is called. This can save a huge amount of disk space and download
time but requires more manual intervention on the user side.

<p>
<blockquote>groupdelaybody = some.news.group</blockquote>
If you want delaybody mode only for selected groups, you can enable
this download mode for one specific group.  The global delaybody
switch above causes all groups to be treated that way.  Use one line
per group pattern.

<p>
<blockquote>debugmode = 260</blockquote>
This option forces the leafnode programs into logging lots of
information via the syslog daemon. It is only useful if you
want to hunt down bugs. See config.example for an explanation of the number here.

<h3 align=center>4.2. The filter file</h3>

<p>The filter file format is currently described in fetchnews(5). Type man 5
filterfile or man -s 5 filterfile to see the description.

<HR>
<h3 align=center>5. LOCAL NEWSGROUPS</h3>

<p>From version 2.0 on, Leafnode is able to handle local newsgroups.
Local newsgroups are groups that exist only on your local server but not
on upstream servers.

<p>To create a local newsgroup, you have to think of a newsgroup name
which should not exist on any of your upstream servers. It is therefore
a good idea to start a new top-level hierarchy. You should also make up
a description for your newsgroup.

<p>If you choose a newsgroup name which exists already on an upstream
server, the newsgroup is not treated as a local one.

<p>Next, you write the name, status and description into the file
/etc/leafnode/local.groups using your preferred text editor, which must
not mangle TABs to SPACEs.
The file should consist of lines in the format

<pre>
# Comment lines are allowed, with a hash at the beginning of a line.
#
# However, no white space may precede the hash mark, and empty lines
# are not valid.
news.group.name&lt;TAB&gt;status&lt;TAB&gt;description
</pre>
(replace &lt;TAB&gt; with a TAB character!)

<p>The first column of each line is taken as the newsgroup name; the
second as the status (y for "may be posted to", m for "moderated" -- see
below for moderator configuration), the third column of the line is
interpreted as description. For example, to set up a newsgroup
"local.leafnode" which deals with Leafnode's internals, you would put a
line

<blockquote>
local.leafnode&lt;TAB&gt;y&lt;TAB&gt;Local leafnode user group
</blockquote>

into /etc/leafnode/local.groups. (If your configuration does not reside
in /etc/leafnode, replace this part of the pathname with the appropriate
directory.)

<h4 align=center>5.1 MODERATED NEWSGROUPS</h4>

<P>From version 2.0 on, Leafnode also handles <strong>moderated</strong>
newsgroups. These are newsgroups which only certain people may post
into, and articles which a regular (non-moderator) user posts, are
mailed to the moderator. 

<P>External moderated newsgroups are handled by the upstream servers.

<P>To configure the moderators for <strong>local</strong> moderated
groups, an INN-compatible "moderators" file is used. It is named
/etc/leafnode/moderators and has the following format:

<PRE>
pattern:moderator
</PRE>

<p>Empty lines and lines that start with a hash character (#) are
considered comment lines and are ignored.

<p>The <strong>pattern</strong> is a normal wildmat pattern, which means
that it's a SHELL pattern, the most useful character is the asterisk (*)
which matches any sequence of characters. The moderator given on that
line applies to all groups that the pattern matches. Should multiple
lines match a group, the first match in the file "wins", the second and
subsequent patterns are not taken into account. So put the more special
patterns first.

<p>The <strong>moderator</strong> is a regular internet mail address,
with the exception that the first occurrence of "%s" is replaced with
the newsgroup name, with dots (.) converted to dashes (-) for INN
compatibility.

<p>Example:

<PRE>
# This is a comment line
#
# special moderator, hans@example.com is mailed all articles for
# local.special
local.special:hans@example.com
# moderator for all other local groups:
local.*:egon+%s@example.net
# that means:
# mail postings for local.test to egon+local-test@example.net
