.SH NAME
texpire \- delete old news article threads

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texpire [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [-afnr] [group.name [...]]
.br
.B texpire [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [-n] -C message.id [...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
The design of
.B leafnode
is intended to repair any problems itself, to detect what newsgroups
the users read, and to require no manual manual maitenance.
.PP
.B Texpire
is the program which deletes old articles from the local news spool,
rehashes the spool after updates of leafnode.

.SH OPTIONS
For a description of the \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR, see
.BR leafnode (8).
.TP
.I -C messageid [...]
Cancel mode: This will attempt to remove the articles with
given Message-ID numbers from the spool. Note that the Message-ID must
be given with angle brackets; remember to use single quotes to protect
the Message-IDs from the shell. Note that this will not queue cancel
messages to the upstream, but have solely local effect.
.TP
.I -a
Expire individual articles rather than threads.
.TP
.I -f
Expire will look at the arrival time of the articles rather than at the
access time. Expiry will still be thread-based unless \fI-a\fR is given.
.TP
.I -n
Dry run mode. In this mode, texpire will not delete anything, it will
just write what it would do without -n.
.TP
.I -r
Repair and migrate mode. In this mode, texpire tries to save as much of the news
spool as it can. This mode MUST be used when upgrading to a leafnode
version which has a different hash function for messageid than the
version previously installed. If in doubt, use -r after an update.
.PP
If further arguments are found on the command line, but -C (cancel mode,
see above) is not given, the arguments are treated as group names and
only the given groups are expired. By default, all groups are expired.

.SH FILES
.I @sysconfdir@/config.example
documents the debug modes.

See
.BR leafnode (8)
for the list of other files affected.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.B Texpire
ignores "Expires" headers.
.PP
.B Texpire
is unable to delete articles in groups where article numbers are far
apart, because the required memory depends on the difference between
lowest and highest article number in that group.
