### the next lines will kill descrambler spam in all groups
### d-e-s-c-r-a-m-b-l-e-r or d.e.s.c.r.a.m.b.l.e.r are detected
newsgroups = *
pattern = ^Subject:.*D.*E.S.C.R.A.M.B.L.E.R
action = kill

### this inherits the last newsgroups line and also kills cable box
### descrambler spam
pattern = ^Subject:.*CABLE.*BOX.*DESCRAMBLER
action = kill

### do not accept articles older than 20 days
maxage = 20
action = kill

### do not fetch articles beyond 100,000 bytes
maxbytes = 100000
action = kill

### do not fetch articles posted to more than five groups
### Note: this will in many cases only work after the article
### has been downloaded, so it's not too efficient for your
### bandwidth, but it keeps your newsgroups tidy unless your
### newsreader tracks crossposts -- not many do :-(
maxcrosspost = 5
action = kill

### this limits traffic for a high-traffic group
newsgroups = de.rec.fotografie
maxage = 7
action = kill

### this gets you rid of German Outlook national oddities
### and pre-threading Re^N style subjects
###
### Be very careful when using the | operator, either of the sides will
### match, so "^Subject: Jens|Jan" will kill all articles posted in
### January because it means "^Subject: Jens" or "Jan". Use "^Subject:
### (Jens|Jan)" instead (don't type the quote marks!)
newsgrops = *
pattern = ^Subject: (AW|WG|Re^\d+):
