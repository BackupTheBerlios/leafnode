.SH NAME
rnews \- sort batch files into spool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rnews [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [file|directory]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Leafnode
is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there are few
users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups is
desired.
.PP
.B Rnews
is the program that sorts files (possibly received with UUCP) into your newsspool.
.B Rnews
can currently take compressed and uncompressed news batches as well as news
articles.
.B Rnews will avoid copying the file around and is able to read from a
stream. To achieve this, it may fork() twice and spawn an external
decompressor.
.B Rnews
expects the news batch either in a file, directory or on stdin. If provided
with the name of a directory, it will open the directory and sort all files
inside this directory into the news spool. Rnews will not recursively descend
through directories.
.PP
.B Rnews
sets its real and effective uid to "news".

.SH OPTIONS
For a description of the \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR, see
.BR leafnode (8).
.TP
.I file
Sort this file into the newsspool. The file can also be a rnews batch,
optionally compressed.
.TP
.I directory
Sort the contents of all files in this directory into the newsspool.

.SH BUGS
.B Rnews
leaks some bytes of memory (the command line arguments to the
external compressor program.)
