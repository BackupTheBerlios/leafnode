.SH NAME
rnews \- sort batch files into spool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rnews [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [file|directory]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLeafnode\fR is a USENET package intended for small sites, where there
are few users and little disk space, but where a large number of groups
is desired.
.PP
\fBRnews\fR is the program that sorts files (possibly received with
UUCP) into your newsspool. \fBRnews\fR can currently take compressed (see
below) and uncompressed ("rnews") news batches as well as news
articles. \fBRnews\fR will avoid copying the file around and is able to
read from a stream. To achieve this, it may fork() twice and spawn an
external decompressor.

.SS INPUT
\fBRnews\fR expects the news batch either in a
file, directory or on standard input. If provided with the name of a
directory, it will open the directory and sort all files inside this
directory into the news spool. Rnews will \fInot\fR recursively descend
through directories.
.PP
\fBRnews\fR sets its real and effective uid to "news" (or whatever else
was configured).

.SS COMPRESSED BATCH FORMATS (UNBATCH)
.PP
\fBRnews\fR recognizes cunbatch, gunbatch and zunbatch and will feed
either through gzip -c -d.
.PP
\fBRnews\fR recognizes bunbatch and will feed it through bzip2 -c -d.
.PP
These formats are not run-time configurable. To add/change this
behaviour, it is necessary to modify rnews.c, recompile and reinstall.

.SH OPTIONS
For a description of the \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR, see
.BR leafnode (8).
.TP
.I file
Sort this file into the newsspool. The file can also be a rnews batch,
optionally compressed.
.TP
.I directory
Sort the contents of all files in this directory into the newsspool.

.SH BUGS
.B Rnews
leaks some bytes of memory (the command line arguments to the
external compressor program.)
