		   Leafnode 2.0b8_ma branch TODO list
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: issues fixes in the current, possibly unreleased _ma versions, but
persistent in the offical 2.0b tree, are not listed here.


This is a PRIORITIZED LIST. It has two columns, first the importance,
second the urgence. (Matthias)

importance:
1 = most important, 5 = forget it
urgence:
1 = do now, 5 = postpone until bored

"security relevant": at most 2.2

"works correctly, but suboptimal": importance and urgence at least 3.3

0.0 Alexander Reinwarth: "does it work on FreeBSD?"

0.0 rnews is currently deactivated. Work in progress. Will have to
    reintroduce rnews and find a way to feed news batches to UUCP mode
    upstream (also listed at 3.3).

1.1 article can be given out in spite of missing message.id file

1.1 fix posting issues, introduce per-server queues?

1.1 .overview must always be more current than groupinfo, so that nntpd
    never offers article via GROUP that it cannot provide via XOVER
    e. g. (Stefan Wiens)

1.1 out.going: "Nur, wenn ich fetchnews aufrufe, ohne Online zu
    sein, geht das Posting verschütt. Ohne Fehlermeldung." Ivo Schwalbe,
    <51nig9.kv.ln@abu.ivos.de>
    NOTE: only worked around, not fixed.
    TODO: only delete articles successfully posted

1.1 leafnode may store newly fetched articles into the gaps if groupinfo
    is not current. groupinfo may be out of date after a crash, fix
    watermarks.

1.1 groupinfo not updated after timeout + subsequent SIGINT
    ACTION: check if report still current

1.1 split post functionality from fetchnews to a separate daemon (but
    maybe call the new daemon automatically) Ozz 2001-06-12

1.3 authinfo handling in nntpd.c proper? (just user gives ACCEPT)
    ACTION: replace by proper state machine

2.2 for posts to moderated groups, add server preferences for posting?

2.2 make user that leafnode runs under (now hard-wired to "news") configurable

2.2 also run feedincoming on exit of programs that lock

2.2 do not store cancel and perhaps other control messages locally?

2.2 cancelwatch

2.2 heed Expires: header in texpire

2.2 Check RPM build

2.2 pipeline GROUP commands for speed

2.2 Create rpost/inews

2.2 progress displays on terminals for fetchnews and texpire

2.2 Fix and amend copyright statements and licenses.

2.2 groupinfo is not updated for local groups (article low/high marks)
    when these are reinserted.

2.2 strings returned by {f,m,}getheader must be freed (Stefan Wiens)
    ACTION: work in progress.
    FIX: Use garbage collector instead?

2.2 nntpd Control-Nachrichten und Artikel in moderierte Newsgroups
    werden auch angezeigt. (Letzteres ist u.U. gar nicht so tragisch,
    denn es verhindert, dass Newbies ihre "moderierten" Postings
    wiederholt abschicken.) -> RFC violation (reported by Jörg Dietrich).

2.2 report Raymond Scholz, rnews doesn't read from pipes.
    ACTION: reimplement rnews from scratch.

2.2 tolerate ", " instead of just "," in Newsgroup:
    current NNTP drafts suggests that to be able to fold Newsgroup: headers.
    ACTION: work in progress, fixed in some places.

2.2 convert Newsgroup: to lowercase on external newsgroups.

2.2 option to freeze interesting.groups as it is -- just give away group
    permissions to root -- Ozz 2001-06-12

2.2 groupinfo is all 0 0 0 if groupinfo is entirely re-read, until
    texpire is run.

2.2 "rnews does not work in pipes", Jörg Dietrich,
    <3AF40BA6.BeroList-2.5.9@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de>
    See 0.0 above as well.

2.3 "Das ist eine Macke von Leafnode. Wird von einem Server die
    komplette Gruppenliste geholt, so werden neu hinzugekommene Gruppen
    bei NEWGROUPS nicht aufgeführt. Der Reader findet sie daher nicht
    ohne weiteres." (Stefan Wiens, de.comm.software.newsserver
    2000-12-07, Message-ID: <wkr93lxerw.fsf@helium.eswe.dyndns.org>)
    Transl: if a complete group list is fetched from a server, newly
    appeared groups are not offered in NEWGROUPS.
    ACTION: fix.
    Idea #1: Possibly emit list from mergegroups
    Idea #2: diff newsgroups list before and after group list fetch
    Idea #3: Store newsgroups in timestamped file.

2.3 if XHDR and XOVER fail, fall back to HEAD!
    ACTION: implement HEAD

3.3 Ben Holmes: read newsgroups immediately after completion of their
    download, rather than only after fetchnews completed.

3.3 add support for stderr logging so that multilog can be used
    (clemensF <rabat@web.de>).

3.3 add IHAVE support for feeding upstream

3.3 document NOPOSTING env variable that prevents posting

3.3 does not send UUCP to upstream, introduce option to batch and spool
    UUCP

3.3 Fix nntputil.c and nntpd.c for proper IPv6 (getipnodebyname/byaddr
    etc.)

3.3 don't supersede() articles unconditionally
    ACTION: figure criteria for allowing/denying supersede

3.3 gethostbyname is not subject to timeout control

3.3 make PAM aware (Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD) to get rid of crypt

3.3 ACLs (possibly including identd) or regexp to prevent groups from
    being shown (mind ARTICLE <message@id> and check against Xref or
    Newsgroups: headers)

3.3 ACLs (possibly including identd) or regexp to filter which groups
    may be subscribed to (could include user specific)

3.3 clean up fetchnews main function, it's a horrible mess with all
    those !postonly, unmaintainable.

3.3 Hook (ext. program) for editing group info,
    <slrn9e1dv6.3il.wum@wum.truhaso.lu> and
    <m3snj2d3k1.fsf@emma1.emma.line.org>

3.3 fetchnews -N does not work
    Jürgen Salk, Message-ID:
    <3A3E8E47.BeroList-2.5.9@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de>

3.3 run everything through various static and dynamic checkers
    (efence, dmalloc, lclint)

3.3 get rid of _all_ sscanf (Matthias Andree)

3.3 forbid crosspostings to local and global groups. (consider this for
    local posts and check whether to ignore this for downstream pulled
    articles)

3.3 how to make newsgroup names 8-bit compliant? E.g., how to produce
    a newsgroups line of the form
	Newsgroups: norge.østfold
    Some readers encode this as ISO-8859-1 but this apparently is not
    understood upstream. It is also against the RFCs. son-of-rfc1036
    says that all data must be transmitted with ASCII < 127.
    draft-ietf-nntpext-base-07.txt says that the character set for all
    NNTP commands is UTF-8 (unicode!). Another possible draft is
    draft-ietf-usefor-article-01.txt (chapter 5.5.) which is not very
    helpful either.

3.3 fetchnews starts with an initialfetch (!)

3.3 let texpire use the actual article date rather than mtime/atime

3.3 send posted articles out immediately -- based on switches or
    filters? MID <3C10FC04.BeroList-2.5.9@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de>?
    Ben Holness.

3.4 postarticles is a horrible mess. It deletes the articles IMMEDIATELY
    if it's available on a server.

4.2 get rid of all those if (verbose > anything)

4.3 move old articles from out.going to failed.postings if they are,
    say, 7 days, old? (Report by Stefan Wiens, Message-ID:
    <3A1EDBFF.BeroList-2.5.9@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de>)

4.4 implement detection if local group shadows server group

4.4 NOPOSTING: replace the banner with the contents of this variable.

4.4 can fetchnews cope with servers that reject XOVER? (Matthias Andree)

4.4 signal needs to be worked around on Solaris 7 (Matthias Andree)

4.4 server dependent out.going, possibly a repost command?

4.4 interrupt fetch every 100 (configurable) postings and then
    reconnect, to beat the INN configuration option.

4.4 see if the dots that NNTP servers escape can remain in the articles
    so that the body can be passed through to the client 1:1 (would need
    review if CR is required, and would break "direct spool" operation)

5.5 getgroup: "%s: considering %ld articles %lu - %lu" does not include
    proper article count as sent by server, but just uses last-first+1

5.5 determine interesting groups from .newsrc?
    REJECT: other newsreaders have different formats

5.5 delaybody only for certain groups?

5.5 introduce Control: pseudo group functionality

5.5 abort group fetch and proceed to next group
